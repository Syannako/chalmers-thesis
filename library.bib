abstract = {This paper presents the illumination compensation technique for document images using local-global block analysis. Imbalance illumination will affect the performance of classification and segmentation process because the darker regions conceal the information of the image. This method will split the image into non-overlapped blocks, and utilize the information within the local and global area of the image. The output images were binarized with simple global thresholding technique and the result shows that the output image is comparable in quality with the existed method. A comparative result will be presented with other document binarization methods.},

Preliminary computational experience using this transformation, shows that a pure logical solver can be a valuable tool for solving specific binary linear programming problems, namely those that are in a sense ‘almost’ satisfiability problems. In a number of cases it competes favorably with well-known techniques from operations research.},

abstract = {In this paper we describe a decision procedure for the core theory of fixed-sized bit-vectors with extraction and composition that can readily be integrated into Shostak's procedure for deciding combinations of theories. Inputs to the solver are unquantified bit-vector equations t=u and the algorithm returns true if t=u is valid in the bit-vector theory, false if t=u is unsatisfiable, and a system of solved equations otherwise. The time complexity of the solver is $$\mathcal{O}\left( {\left| t \right| \cdot log{\text{ }}n + n^2 } \right)$$ , where t is the length of the bit-vector term t and n denotes the number of bits on either side of the equation. Then, the solver for the core bit-vector theory is extended to handle other bit-vector operations like bitwise logical operations, shifting, and arithmetic interpretations of bit-vectors. We develop a BDD-like data-structure called bit-vector BDDs to represent bit-vectors, various operations on bit-vectors, and a solver on bit-vector BDDs.},

@book{Pine1992,
abstract = {The mass production of standardized goods was the source of America's economic strength for generations and became the model for successful industries. Today, that model is a major cause of the nation's declining competitiveness. As Joe Pine makes clear, innovative companies are embracing a new paradigm of management--mass customization--that allows them to create greater variety and customization in their products and services at competitive prices, or better. He explains mass customization in its historical context, demonstrates why mass production cannot work in turbulent industries, and outlines how new forms of competition have led to greater variety and customization. Based upon academic and field research, his work is a thoughtful analysis and commentary on when and how managers in both service and manufacturing industries can make the transition to mass customization. He details the strategies, methods, and organizational transformations required to develop, produce, market, and deliver individually customized goods and services, and shows managers how to analyze their own industries to determine if they should shift to mass customization},

abstract = {The effective integration of configuration system development with industrial software development is crucial for a successful implementation of a mass customization strategy. On the one hand, configuration knowledge bases must be easy to develop and maintain due to continuously changing product assortments. On the other hand, flexible integrations into existing enterprise applications, e-marketplaces and different facets of supply chain settings must be supported. This paper shows how the model-driven architecture (MDA) as an industrial framework for model development and interchange can serve as a foundation for standardized configuration knowledge representation, thus enabling knowledge sharing in heterogeneous environments. Using UML/Object Constraint Language as standard configuration knowledge representation languages, the representation of configuration domain-specific modeling concepts within MDA is shown and a formal semantics for these concepts is provided which allows a common understanding and interpretation of configuration task descriptions},

abstract = {We compare 12 new encodings for representing of FPGA detailed routing problems as equivalent Boolean satisfiability (SAT) problems against the only 2 previously used encodings. We also consider two symmetry-breaking heuristics. Compared to other methods for FPGA detailed routing, SAT-based approaches have the advantage that they can prove the unroutability of a global routing for a particular number of tracks per channel, and that they consider all nets simultaneously. The experiments were run on the standard MCNC benchmarks. The combination of one new encoding with a new symmetry-breaking heuristic resulted in speedup of 3 orders of magnitude or 1,139x of the total execution time on the collection of benchmarks, when proving the unroutability of FPGA global routings. The maximum obtained speedup was 9,499x on an individual benchmark. On the other hand, most of the encodings had comparable and very efficient performance when finding solutions for configurations that were routable. The availability of many SAT encodings, that can each be combined with various symmetry-breaking heuristics, opens the possibility to design portfolios of parallel strategies - each a combination of a SAT encoding and a symmetry- breaking heuristic - that can be run in parallel on different cores of a multicore CPU in order to reduce the solution time, with the rest of the runs terminated as soon as one of them returns an answer. We found that a portfolio of three particular parallel strategies produced additional speedup of more than 2x.},

abstract = {Abstract&nbsp;&nbsp;The significance of systems configurations has been increased in many applied domains (e.g., software, hardware, manufacturing systems, communication systems, supply chain systems, solving strategies, modular planning, material engineering and combinatorial chemistry). Generally, the following kinds of systems under configuration (reconfiguration) can be examined: (a) initial data/infomation (or row materials); (b) processing systems (machines, computers, algorithms); (c) resultant decisions (e.g., products, plans); (d) applied support systems (e.g., network systems, services); (e) requirements; and (f) standards. In the paper several system configuration problems are investigated: (i) searching for (selection of) a set (structure) of system components, (ii) searching for a set of compatible system components, (iii) allocation of system components, (iv) reconfiguration of a system as redesign of the system structure, (v) multi-stage design and redesign of system configuration, (vi) design or redesign of the system configuration for multi-product systems, and (vii) design of system hierarchy. Combinatorial optimization models (including multicriteria statements) are under examination: multiple choice problem, allocation problem, graph coloring problems, morphological clique problem (with compatibility of system components), multipartite clique and their modifications, spanning trees problems.},

abstract = {Over-constrained problems can have an exponential number of conflicts, which explain the failure, and an exponential number of relaxations, which restore the consistency. A user of an interactive application, however, desires explanations and relaxations containing the most important constraints. To address this need, we define preferred explanations and relaxations based on user preferences between constraints and we compute them by a generic method which works for arbitrary CP, SAT, or DL solvers. We significantly accelerate the basic method by a divide-and-conquer strategy and thus provide the technological basis for the explanation facility of a principal industrial constraint programming tool, which is, for example, used in numerous configuration applications.},

abstract = {In cases where the discrete-event system model has an infinite or large state space, or when it is not completely specified a priori, applying the traditional off-line methods for computing the control policy may be impractical, if not infeasible. We adopt an online limited lookahead approach. Under this approach, the next control action is determined based on an N-step ahead projection of the system behavior and on one of two attitudes-conservative or optimistic. We extend this approach to incorporate knowledge of the system state in the computation. This has the potential of improving the efficiency of the computation as well as the quality of the control policy. There are five specific contributions presented in this paper: 1) a new algorithm for the online computation of supervisory controls with worst case complexity that is quadratic in the number of &ldquo;expanded&rdquo; states, 2) an algorithmic proof of the correctness of this algorithm that avoids using fixed point methods and offers new insight into the structure of the supremal controllable sublanguage, 3) an off-line version based on a forward search technique that has the same worst case complexity as existing off-line algorithms but is potentially more efficient, 4) a formal proof of the fact that when the languages of interest are livelock free the computations are performed in linear complexity, and 5) new bounds on the depth of the lookahead window that guarantee optimality},

abstract = {Boolean satisfiability (SAT) solvers have been the subject of remarkable improvements since the mid 90s. One of the main reasons for these improvements has been the wide range of practical applications of SAT. Indeed, examples of modern applications of SAT range from termination analysis in term-rewrite systems to circuit-level prediction of crosstalk noise. The success of SAT solvers motivated many practical applications, but many practical applications have also provided the examples and the challenges that allowed the development of more efficient SAT solvers. This paper provides an overview of some of the most well-known applications of SAT and outlines several other successful applications of SAT. Moreover, the improvements in SAT solvers motivated the development of new algorithms for strategic extensions of SAT. As a result, the paper also provides a brief survey of recent work on extensions of SAT, including pseudo-Boolean constraints, maximum satisfiability, model counting and quantified Boolean formulas.},

As an alternative a global optimisation algorithm, the particle swarm optimisation method, has also been investigated. The results show that by exploiting a priori dielectric data in this way a significant improvement in the resolving ability can be obtained. Finally Tikonov and edge preserving regularisation has been investigated and a modified regularisation scheme, supporting the a priori data is suggested},

abstract = {The developer of logic control systems is faced with increasing complexity of the functions to be implemented and, at the same time, increasing demands on the reliability of the resulting software. To analyze the reliability of such complex systems formal methods can be applied. One area of the corresponding research is focused on the application of model checking techniques to Programmable Logic Controllers (PLCs). In this paper a new method to formalize PLC programs together with a model of the cyclic behavior of the PLC is presented. The control systems behavior is modeled, and then the program, written in Instruction List, is formalized and integrated into the model. The formalization in SMV language is suitable for verification using BDD and SAT techniques. Both techniques are compared using first results of a case study.},

abstract = {Unpredictability in the running time of complete search procedures can often be explained by the phenomenon of “heavy-tailed cost distributions”, meaning that at any time during the experiment there is a non-negligible probability of hitting a problem that requires exponentially more time to solve than any that has been encountered before (Gomes et al. 1998a). We present a general method for introducing con- trolled randomization into complete search algorithms. The “boosted” search methods provably eliminate heavy-tails to the right of the median. Furthermore, they can take advan- tage of heavy-tails to the left of the median (that is, a non- negligible chance of very short runs) to dramatically shorten the solution time. We demonstrate speedups of several or- ders of magnitude for state-of-the-art complete search pro- cedures running on hard, real-world problems.},

Functions are represented by directed, acyclic graphs in a manner similar to the representations introduced by Lee [1] and Akers [2], but with further restrictions on the ordering of decision variables in the graph. Although a function requires, in the worst case, a graph of size exponential in the number of arguments, many of the functions encountered in typical applications have a more reasonable representation. Our algorithms have time complexity proportional to the sizes of the graphs being operated on, and hence are quite efficient as long as the graphs do not grow too large. We present experimental results from applying these algorithms to problems in logic design verification that demonstrate the practicality of our approach.},

abstract = {Validation has emerged as a significant problem in the development of knowledge- based systems (KBS). Verification of KBS correctness and completeness has been cited as one of the most difficult aspects of validation. A number of software tools have been developed to perform such verification, but none of these are in widespread use. One of the reasons for this is that little quantitative evidence exists to demonstrate the effectiveness of the tools. This paper presents an experimental study of three KBS verification tools: a consistency checker, a completeness checker and a testing tool (for correctness). The tools are evaluated on their ability to reveal plausible faults seeded into a complex, realistic KBS application. The cost of using the tools is also measured. It is shown that each tool is independently effective at detecting certain kinds of fault and that the capabilities of the tools are complementary—a result not revealed by previous studies.},

abstract = {In this paper, we will propose a new solution method for SAT (Satisfiability Problems) using FPGA (Field-Programmable Gate Arrays) and logic synthesis system. This method is distinctive in that a logic circuit specialized to solve each problem instance is configured on FPGA. This approach has become possible due to the progress in reconfigurable computing technology in recent years and opens a new possibility in design principle of algorithms. SAT is a kind of constraint satisfaction problem and is a general framework which can represent many application problems. In this paper, we will propose various algorithms which are suitable for implementation on hardware. Among these algorithms, the one which has the highest performance has a performance equal to the Davis-Putman algorithm which introduced the heuristic with dynamic ordering of variables. From the evaluation results using simulation, we show that by the method proposed herein, the solution of a 3-SAT problem instance with 400 variables generated in a very hard random can be obtained in 1.6 minutes when the circuit is operated at a machine cycle of 10 MHz. Moreover, a very hard problem instance with 128 variables and 256 clauses was packaged on FPGAs and its operation was confirmed. © 2003 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

Industrial PLC vendors are slowly offering support for this standard, however small inconsistencies remain between their implementations, transferring programs between vendors is almost impossible due to different file formats, and licenses are generally too expensive to allow students do install these commercial solutions on their own computers. To this end, the authors have developed an Integrated Development Environment (IDE) for the IEC 61131-3 framework, which is being offered to the general public under the GNU Public License (GPL). The IDE consists of a Graphical User Interface (GUI) and a backend compiler. Using the GUI the user may develop programs in any of the four programming languages, as well as the state machine definition language. The backend compiler is used to convert these programs into equivalent C++ programs which may later be compiled and executed on various platforms.},

abstract = {In the real world, a knowledge-based system (KBS) must often accommodate a considerable number of references which support the particular knowledge domain. The size of such a knowledge repository makes its detailed verification challenging and subsequent maintenance onerous. New technology can help improve both the verification and maintenance of these knowledge repositories. To investigate the effectiveness of new technologies for verification and maintenance, we developed two subsequent versions of a KBS designed to improve the consistency of software measurement using ISO 19761 (the COSMIC-FFP measurement method for software functional size) and COSMIC- FFP guide [3]. The COSMIC-FFP KBS consists of a hybrid knowledge system built on case-based and ruled-based approaches. The first prototype was built in 2000 using Microsoft technology (Visual Basic 6, Access 2000, hyperlink facilities for RTF files). This prototype included 105 case problems and almost 800 files (hyperlinks) for the required references. Because of the high number of files, the verification and validation of this KBS was, of course, very challenging. This led us to design a second KBS, a Web-based prototype (XML, XSL, Java Server Page) which is much easier to verify and validate, leading to considerably improved maintainability and expandability. This paper presents an overview of the selected hybrid KBS approach and of the first and second prototypes. It also illustrates the transitioning and quantitative benefits for the detailed KBS verification and validation process and the lessons learned during this process.},

This work is based on a translation of the satisfiability problem (SAT) into the binary constraint-satisfaction problem (CSP). The structure of the SAT problem and its associated CSP are then exploited together for characterizing tractable SAT problems, increasing the effectiveness of the classical reduction rules: unit clause and monotone literal rules, and expressing the arc and path consistency concepts with logical inference rules. This study leads to compare the behaviors of the DP and MAC procedures for solving respectively a SAT instance and its binary CSP expression.},

abstract = {Models of conﬁgurable products can have hundreds of variables and thousands of conﬁguration constraints. A product engineer usually has a limited responsibility area, and thus is interested in only a small subset of the variables that are relevant to the responsibility area. It is important for the engineer to have an overview of possible products with respect to the responsibility area, with all irrelevant information omitted. Conﬁgurations with some variables omitted we will call partial conﬁgurations, and we will call a partial conﬁguration valid if it can be extended to a complete conﬁguration satisfying all conﬁguration constraints. In this paper we consider exact ways to compute valid partial conﬁgurations: we present two new algorithms based on Boolean satisﬁability solvers, as well as ways to use knowledge compilation methods (Binary Decision Diagrams and Decomposable Negation Normal Form) to compute valid partial conﬁgurations. We also show that the proposed methods are feasible on conﬁguration data from two automotive companies.},

abstract = {The article presents essays from the configuration workshop held in August 2006 as part of ECAI in Riva del Garda, Italy. The essays address reasoning techniques, user interaction, business integration, and finally presents a practical case study. These essays aim to give the readers insight into current trends and challenges in configuration. If you order a computer system online, you likely have the opportunity to customize it to your individual needs: you can choose from different CPUs and main memory sizes, select the appropriate graphics card and hard drive, and so on. However, if the ordering system doesn't accept your configuration as is, you'll have to modify it. For example. a large LCD screen might require a special graphics card, or the CPU you've chosen might require a special main board, With more complex products, such as cars, the situation gets even more complicated - for example, you can choose from hundreds of equipment options when ordering a Mercedes, resulting in millions of possible combinations. Product configuration, the business process that supports these choices, offers both opportunities and challenges},

We analyse four different mappings of SAT problems into CSPs, and two of CSPs into SAT problems. For each mapping, we compare the impact of achieving arc-consistency on the CSP with unit propagation on the SAT problem. We then extend these results to CSP algorithms that maintain (some level of) arc-consistency during search like FC and MAC, and to the Davis-Putnam procedure (which performs unit propagation at each search node). Because of differences in the branching structure of their search, a result showing the dominance of achieving arc-consistency on the CSP over unit propagation on the SAT problem does not necessarily translate to the dominance of MAC over the Davis-Putnam procedure. These results provide insight into the relationship between propositional satisfiability and constraint satisfaction.},

abstract = {Feature Models are used in different stages of software development  and are recognized to be an important asset in model transformation techniques  and software product line development. The automated analysis of feature models  is being recognized as one of the key challenges for automated software development  in the context of Software Product Lines. In our previous work we  explained how a feature model can be transformed into a constraint satisfaction  problem. However cardinalities were not considered. In this paper we present  how a cardinality-based feature model can be also translated into a constraint  satisfaction problem. In that connection, it is possible to use off-the-shelf tools to  automatically accomplish several tasks such as calculating the number of possible  feature configurations and detecting possible conflicts. In addition, we present a  performance test between two off-the-shelf Java constraint solvers. To the best of  our knowledge, this is the first time a performance test is presented using solvers  for feature modelling proposes  1},

abstract = {In this paper, we propose a new method to encode Constraint Satisfaction Problems (CSP) and Constraint Optimization Problems (COP) with integer linear constraints into Boolean Satisfiability Testing Problems (SAT). The encoding method (named order encoding) is basically the same as the one used to encode Job-Shop Scheduling Problems by Crawford and Baker. Comparison x ≤ a is encoded by a different Boolean variable for each integer variable x and integer value a. To evaluate the effectiveness of this approach, we applied the method to the Open-Shop Scheduling Problems (OSS). All 192 instances in three OSS benchmark sets are examined, and our program found and proved the optimal results for all instances including three previously undecided problems.},

abstract = {A general method that represents the state space symbolically instead of explicitly is described. The generality of the method comes from using a dialect of the mu-calculus as the primary specification language. A model-checking algorithm for mu-calculus formulas which uses R.E. Bryant's (1986) binary decision diagrams to represent relations and formulas symbolically is described. It is then shown how the novel mu-calculus model checking algorithm can be used to derive efficient decision procedures for CTL model checking, satisfiability of linear-time temporal logic formulas, strong and weak observational equivalence of finite transition systems, and language containment of finite &omega;-automata. This eliminates the need to describe complicated graph-traversal or nested fixed-point computations for each decision procedure. The authors illustrate the practicality of their approach to symbolic model checking by discussing how it can be used to verify a simple synchronous pipeline},

@inproceedings{Marques-Silva2007a,
abstract = {Motivated by the performance improvements made to SAT solvers in recent years, a number of different encodings of constraints into SAT have been proposed. Concrete examples are the different SAT encodings for ≤ 1 (x 1,...,x n ) constraints. The most widely used encoding is known as the pairwise encoding, which is quadratic in the number of variables in the constraint. Alternative encodings are in general linear, and require using additional auxiliary variables. In most settings, the pairwise encoding performs acceptably well, but can require unacceptably large Boolean formulas. In contrast, linear encodings yield much smaller Boolean formulas, but in practice SAT solvers often perform unpredictably. This lack of predictability is mostly due to the large number of auxiliary variables that need to be added to the resulting Boolean formula. This paper studies one specific encoding for ≤ 1 (x 1,...,x n ) constraints, and shows how a state-of-the-art SAT solver can be adapted to overcome the problem of adding additional auxiliary variables. Moreover, the paper shows that a SAT solver may essentially ignore the existence of auxiliary variables. Experimental results indicate that the modified SAT solver becomes significantly more robust on SAT encodings involving ≤ 1 (x 1,...,x n ) constraints.},

abstract = {The spectral approach for graph visualization computes the layout of a graph using certain eigenvectors of related matrices. Some important advantages of this approach are an ability to compute optimal layouts (according to specific requirements) and a very rapid computation time. In this paper we explore spectral visualization techniques and study their properties. We present a novel view of the spectral approach, which provides a direct link between eigenvectors and the aesthetic properties of the layout. In addition, we present a new formulation of the spectral drawing method with some aesthetic advantages. This formulation is accompanied by an aesthetically-motivated algorithm, which is much easier to understand and to implement than the standard numerical algorithms for computing eigenvectors.},

abstract = {Product configuration is a crucial means to implement the mass customization paradigm by assembling a set of customizable components to satisfy both customers’ needs and technical constraints. With the aim of enabling efficient and effective development of product configuration systems by reusing configuration knowledge, an ontology-based approach to modeling product configuration knowledge is presented in this paper. The ontology-based product configuration models are hierarchically organized. At the lower level, a configuration meta-model is defined. Based on this meta-model, domain-specific configuration knowledge can be derived by reusing or inheriting the classes or relations in the meta-model. Configuration models are formalized using OWL (Ontology Web Language), an ontology representation language developed by W3C. As a result, configuration models have well-defined semantics due to the logic semantics of OWL, making it possible to automatically detect inconsistencies of configuration knowledge bases. Furthermore, configuration constraints are represented in SWRL, a rule language based on OWL. Finally, actual configuration processes are carried out using JESS, a rule engine for the Java platform, by mapping OWL-based configuration facts and SWRL-based configuration constraints into JESS facts and JESS rules, respectively. The proposed methodology is illustrated with an example for configuring the ranger drilling machine.},

@inproceedings{Pan2005,
abstract = {Recent work has shown how to use OBDDs for satisfiability solving. The idea of this approach, which we call symbolic quantifier elimination, is to view an instance of propositional satisfiability as an existentially quantified propositional formula. Satisfiability solving then amounts to quantifier elimination; once all quantifiers have been eliminated we are left with either 1 or 0. Our goal in this work is to study the effectiveness of symbolic quantifier elimination as an approach to satisfiability solving. To that end, we conduct a direct comparison with the DPLL-based ZChaff, as well as evaluate a variety of optimization techniques for the symbolic approach. In comparing the symbolic approach to ZChaff, we evaluate scalability across a variety of classes of formulas. We find that no approach dominates across all classes. While ZChaff dominates for many classes of formulas, the symbolic approach is superior for other classes of formulas. Once we have demonstrated the viability of the symbolic approach, we focus on optimization techniques for this approach. We study techniques from constraint satisfaction for finding a good plan for performing the symbolic operations of conjunction and of existential quantification. We also study various variable-ordering heuristics, finding that while no heuristic seems to dominate across all classes of formulas, the maximum-cardinality search heuristic seems to offer the best overall performance.},

A divide-and-conquer algorithm is used to compute the electronic structure, where non-additive contribution to the kinetic energy is included with an embedded cluster scheme. Electronic wave functions are represented on a real-space grid, which is augmented with coarse multigrids to accelerate the convergence of iterative solutions and adaptive fine grids around atoms to accurately calculate ionic pseudopotentials. Spatial decomposition is employed to implement the hierarchical-grid algorithm on massively parallel computers. A converged solution to the electronic-structure problem is obtained for a 32,768-atom amorphous CdSe system on 512 IBM POWER4 processors. The total energy is well conserved during MD simulations of liquid Rb, showing the applicability of this algorithm to first principles MD simulations. The parallel efficiency is 0.985 on 128 Intel Xeon processors for a 65,536-atom CdSe system.},

abstract = {Abstract&nbsp;&nbsp;This article presents a new low-overhead framework for representing and utilizing problem symmetry in propositional satisfiability algorithms. While many previous approaches have focused on symmetry extraction as a key component, the novelty in the proposed strategy lies in using high level problem description to pass on symmetry information to the SAT solver in a simple and concise form, in addition to the usual conjunctive normal form formula. This information, comprising of the so-called symmetry sets and variable classes, captures variable semantics relevant to “complete multi-class symmetry” and is utilized dynamically to prune the search space. This allows us to address many limitations of alternative approaches like symmetry breaking predicates, implicit pseudo-Boolean representations, general group-theoretic methods, and zero-suppressed binary decision diagrams. We demonstrate the efficacy of our technique through a solver called SymChaff, which achieves exponential speedup over one of the best systematic SAT solvers on problems from both theory and practice, often by simply using natural tags or annotation in the problem specification.},

abstract = {Most of the algorithms developed within the Constraint Satisfaction Problem (CSP) framework cannot be used as such to solve interactive decision support problems, like product configuration. Indeed, in such problems, the user is in charge of assigning values to variables. Global consistency maintaining is only one among several functionalities that should be offered by aCSP-based platform in order to help the user in her task; other important functionalities include providing explanations for some user’s choices and ways to restore consistency. This paper presents an extension of the CSP framework in this direction. The key idea consists in considering and handling the user’s choices as assumptions. From a theoretical point of view, the complexity issues of various computational tasks involved in interactive decision support problems are investigated. The results cohere with what is known when Boolean constraints are considered and show all the tasks intractable in the worst case. Since interactivity requires short response times, intractability must be circumvented some way. To this end, we present a new method for compiling configuration problems, that can be generalized to valued CSPs. Specifically, an automaton representing the set of solutions of the CSP is first computed off-line, then this data structure is exploited so as to ensure both consistency maintenance and computation of maximal consistent subsets of user’s choices in an efficient way.},

To ensure their reliability and dependability, it is therefore important that these systems are verified and validated before they are deployed. This paper provides perspectives on issues and problems that impact the verification and validation (V&V) of KBS. Some of the reasons V&V of KBS is difficult are presented. The paper also provides an overview of different techniques and tools that have been developed for performing V&V activities. Finally, some of the research issues that are relevant for future work in this field are discussed.},

@article{Flordal06automaticPlc,
abstract = {In industrial production lines, for example in the automotive industry, cells with multiple industrial robots are common. In such cells, each robot has to avoid running into static obstacles and when the robots work together in a shared space they must also avoid colliding with each other. Typically, the latter is enforced by manually implementing interlocks in programmable logic controllers (PLCs). This is a tedious, error-prone task that is a bottleneck in the development of production lines. The PLC-code being man-made also greatly complicates the maintenance and reconfiguration of such production lines. However, in industry today, a lot of development of robot cells is made offline in 3D simulation environments which enables the use of computers also for deciding and implementing the necessary coordination. This paper presents a method that makes use of information in a robot simulation environment in order to automatically extract finite state models. These models can be used to generate supervisors for ensuring that the deadlock situations that may arise as a consequence of the introduced interlocks are avoided. It is also possible to optimize the work cycle time for the cell. Finally, PLC-code to supervise the production cell can be automatically generated from the deadlock-free and possibly optimized system model. This approach results in a high flexibility in that the coordination function can be quickly reimplemented whenever necessary. A prototype implementation has been developed making use of a commercial 3D robot simulation tool, and a software tool for supervisor synthesis and code generation. The approach is general and should be possible to implement in most offline robot simulation tools.},

@article{Darwiche2000,
abstract = {We introduced decomposable negation normal form (DNNF) recently as a tractable form of propositional theories, and provided a number of powerful logical operations that can be performed on it in polynomial time. We also presented an algorithm for compiling any conjunctive normal form (CNF) into DNNF and provided a structure-based guarantee on its space and time complexity. We present in this paper a linear-time algorithm for converting an ordered binary decision diagram (OBDD) representation of a propositional theory into an equivalent DNNF, showing that DNNFs scale as well as OBDDs. We also identify a subclass of DNNF which we call deterministic DNNF, d-DNNF, and show that the previous complexity guarantees on compiling DNNF continue to hold for this stricter subclass, which has stronger properties. In particular, we present a new operation on d-DNNF which allows us to count its models under the assertion, retraction and flipping of every literal by traversing the d-DNNF twice. That is, after such traversal, we can test in constant-time: the entailment of any literal by the d-DNNF, and the consistency of the d-DNNF under the retraction or flipping of any literal. We demonstrate the significance of these new operations by showing how they allow us to implement linear-time, complete truth maintenance systems and linear-time, complete belief revision systems for two important classes of propositional theories.},

@article{Bryant2009,
abstract = {Abstract&nbsp;&nbsp;We present a new decision procedure for finite-precision bit-vector arithmetic with arbitrary bit-vector operations. Such decision procedures are essential components of verifications systems, whether the domain of interest is hardware, such as in word-level bounded model-checking of circuits, or software, where one must often reason about programs with finite-precision datatypes. Our procedure alternates between generating under- and over-approximations of the original bit-vector formula. An under-approximation is obtained by a translation to propositional logic in which some bit-vector variables are encoded with fewer Boolean variables than their width. If the under-approximation is unsatisfiable, we use the unsatisfiable core to derive an over-approximation based on the subset of predicates that participated in the proof of unsatisfiability. If this over- approximation is satisfiable, the satisfying assignment guides the refinement of the previous under-approximation by increasing, for some bit-vector variables, the number of Boolean variables that encode them. We present experimental results that suggest that this abstraction-based approach can be considerably more efficient than directly invoking the SAT solver on the original formula as well as other competing decision procedures.},

@book{Crockford2008,
abstract = {Most programming languages contain good and bad parts, but JavaScript has more
than its share of the bad, having been developed and released in a hurry
before it could be refined. This authoritative book scrapes away these bad
features to reveal a subset of JavaScript that's more reliable, readable, and
maintainable than the language as a whole-a subset you can use to create truly
extensible and efficient code. Considered the JavaScript expert by many people
in the development community, author Douglas Crockford identifies the
abundance of good ideas that make JavaScript an outstanding object-oriented
programming language-ideas such as functions, loose typing, dynamic objects,
and an expressive object literal notation. Unfortunately, these good ideas are
mixed in with bad and downright awful ideas, like a programming model based on
global variables. When Java applets failed, JavaScript became the language of
the Web by default, making its popularity almost completely independent of its
qualities as a programming language. In JavaScript: The Good Parts, Crockford
finally digs through the steaming pile of good intentions and blunders to give
you a detailed look at all the genuinely elegant parts of JavaScript,
including: Syntax Objects Functions Inheritance Arrays Regular expressions
Methods Style Beautiful features

The real beauty? As you move ahead with the subset of JavaScript that this
book presents, you'll also sidestep the need to unlearn all the bad parts. Of
course, if you want to find out more about the bad parts and how to use them
badly, simply consult any other JavaScript book. With JavaScript: The Good
Parts, you'll discover a beautiful, elegant, lightweight and highly expressive
language that lets you create effective code, whether you're managing object
libraries or just trying to get Ajax to run fast. If you develop sites or
applications for the Web, this book is an absolute must.},

Boolean cardinality constraints are formulae expressing that at most (resp. at least) k out of n propositional variables are true. We give two novel encodings that improve upon existing results, one which requires only 7n clauses and 2n auxiliary variables, and another one demanding clauses, but with the advantage that inconsistencies can be detected in linear time by unit propagation alone. Moreover, we prove a linear lower bound on the number of required clauses for any such encoding.},

In such systems users continuously refine their specifications which the product has to satisfy. If the specifications are too narrow no product can be retrieved from the product assortment. Instead of just notifying the customer that no product could be found we introduce an approach called ReAction to support customers with minimal repair adaptations. In this paper we give a detailed explanation of our algorithm. Besides that we present the results of a detailed empirical evaluation focussing on the quality as well as on the runtime performance. The work presented is relevant for designers and developers of database systems as well as knowledge-based recommender systems interested in (i) identifying relaxations for database queries, (ii) applying and dealing with user utilities, and (iii) improving the system usability through suggesting minimal repair adaptations for inconsistent queries.},

@article{Een2006,
abstract = {In this paper, we describe and evaluate three different techniques for translating pseudoboolean constraints (linear constraints over boolean variables) into clauses that can be handled by a standard SAT-solver. We show that by applying a proper mix of translation techniques, a SAT-solver can perform on a par with the best existing native pseudo-boolean solvers. This is particularly valuable in those cases where the constraint problem of interest is naturally expressed as a SAT problem, except for a handful of constraints. Translating those constraints to get a pure clausal problem will take full advantage of the latest improvements in SAT research. A particularly interesting result of this work is the efficiency of sorting networks to express pseudo-boolean constraints. Although tangential to this presentation, the result gives a suggestion as to how synthesis tools may be modified to produce arithmetic circuits more suitable for SAT based reasoning. Keywords: pseudo-Boolean, SAT-solver, SAT translation, integer linear programming},

abstract = {A wide range of constraints can be specified using automata or formal languages. The Grammar constraint restricts the values taken by a sequence of variables to be a string from a given context-free language. Based on an AND/OR decomposition, we show that this constraint can be converted into clauses in conjunctive normal form without hindering propagation. Using this decomposition, we can propagate the Grammar constraint in O(n 3) time. The decomposition also provides an efficient incremental propagator. Down a branch of the search tree of length k, we can enforce GAC k times in the same O(n 3) time. On specialized languages, running time can be even better. For example, propagation of the decomposition requires just O(n|$\delta$|) time for regular languages where |$\delta$| is the size of the transition table of the automaton recognizing the regular language. Experiments on a shift scheduling problem with a constraint solver and a state of the art SAT solver show that we can solve problems using this decomposition that defeat existing constraint solvers.},

abstract = {Customers can directly express their preferences on many options when ordering products today. Mass customization manufacturing thus has emerged as a new trend for its aiming to satisfy the needs of individual customers. This process of offering a wide product variety often induces an exponential growth in the volume of information and redundancy for data storage. Thus, a technique for managing product configuration is necessary, on the one hand, to provide customers faster configured and lower priced products, and on the other hand, to translate customers&apos; needs into the product information needed for tendering and manufacturing. This paper presents a decision-making scheme through constructing a product family model (PFM) first, in which the relationship between product, modules, and components are defined. The PFM is then transformed into a product configuration network. A product configuration problem assuming that customers would like to have a minimum-cost and customized product can be easily solved by finding the shortest path in the corresponding product configuration network. Genetic algorithms (GAs), mathematical programming, and tree-searching methods such as uniform-cost search and iterative deepening A* are applied to obtain solutions to this problem. An empirical case is studied in this work as an example. Computational results show that the solution quality of GAs retains 93.89 for a complicated configuration problem. However, the running time of GAs outperforms the running time of other methods with a minimum speed factor of 25. This feature is very useful for a real-time system.},

abstract = {Feature diagrams (FD) are a family of popular modelling languages used for engineering requirements in software product lines. FD were first introduced by Kang as part of the FODA (feature oriented domain analysis) method back in 1990, Since then, various extensions of FODA FD were devised to compensate for a purported ambiguity and lack of precision and expressiveness. However, they never received a proper formal semantics, which is the hallmark of precision and unambiguity as well as a prerequisite for efficient and safe tool automation, In this paper, we first survey FD variants. Subsequently, we generalize the various syntaxes through a generic construction called free feature diagrams (FFD). Formal semantics is defined at the FFD level, which provides unambiguous definition for ail the surveyed FD variants in one shot. All formalisation choices found a clear answer in the original FODA FD definition, which proved that although informal and scattered throughout many pages, it suffered no ambiguity problem. Our definition has several additional advantages: it is formal, concise and generic. We thus argue that it contributes to improve the definition, understanding, comparison and reliable implementation of FD languages},

This work presents efficient methods for reachability search based on symbolic computations using Binary Decision Diagrams. In addition, simple guidelines and quantities for separating hard and easy reachability problems are presented. Furthermore, the performance of the presented algorithms and heuristics is demonstrated on a set of industrial benchmark examples. It is also shown that such examples are much more challenging than some well-known handmade benchmark models. This is also indicated by the presented hardness quantities.},

abstract = {Conditional constraint satisfaction problems (CondCSPs) adequately capture problem change at solving time by conditionally identifying those variables and constraints that are relevant to final solutions. Real-world tasks with dynamic behavior, such as configuration, design, diagnosis, planning, and hardware test generation, have been modeled more naturally with CondCSPs. Such interest has been matched by the development of more effective algorithms that depart from classical backtracking and incorporate local consistency checking. Although performance results have been reported for these specialized algorithms, the experimental analysis has been conducted separately, using different test suites, and little is known about the algorithms' relative performance. In this abstract we present a CondCSP solver that implements direct and reformulation-based algorithms, each of which using forward checking and maintaining local consistency. In our experimental analysis we have considered randomly generated CondCSPs of diverse topologies in terms of problem density and satisfiability of the standard and conditional problem components. Execution time results show that there is not one winner but that reformulation solving in conjunction with forward checking performs better on problems with larger solution sets, while direct solving in conjunction with maintaining arc consistency is always preferred over direct solving using forward checking.},

By using the supervisory control theory it is possible to generate control functions that are correct by construction. However, the computations for verification and synthesis of the supervisors are NP-complete and in order to make the method applicable for industrial use it is necessary to use algorithms and tools that could solve problems of industrial size. Within the model checking community satisfiability solvers have become an important tool for verification of large hardware circuits. In this paper it is shown how to formulate some problems in the supervisory control theory as Boolean satisfiability problems. Formulations of satisfiability problems for synthesizing a path to a marked state, verification of controllability and verification of deadlock presence are presented. The method is evaluated on some examples of high complexity.},

Our work shows how formal methods can be applied to the validation of such business critical data. Our consistency support tool BIS works on an existing database of Boolean constraints expressing valid configurations and their transformation into manufacturable products. Using a specially modified satisfiability checker with an explanation component, BIS can detect inconsistencies in the constraints set and thus help increase the quality of the product data. BIS also supports manufacturing decisions by calculating the implications of product or production environment changes on the set of required parts. In this paper, we give a comprehensive account of BIS: the formalization of the business processes underlying its construction, the modifications of satisfiability-checking technology we found necessary in this context, and the software technology used to package the product as a client–server information system.},

abstract = {Human RAD51 protein (HsRad51) catalyses the DNA strand exchange reaction for homologous recombination. To clarify the molecular mechanism of the reaction in vitro being more effective in the presence of Ca(2+) than of Mg(2+), we have investigated the effect of these ions on the structure of HsRad51 filament complexes with single- and double-stranded DNA, the reaction intermediates. Flow linear dichroism spectroscopy shows that the two ionic conditions induce significantly different structures in the HsRad51/single-stranded DNA complex, while the HsRad51/double-stranded DNA complex does not demonstrate this ionic dependence. In the HsRad51/single-stranded DNA filament, the primary intermediate of the strand exchange reaction, ATP/Ca(2+) induces an ordered conformation of DNA, with preferentially perpendicular orientation of nucleobases relative to the filament axis, while the presence of ATP/Mg(2+), ADP/Mg(2+) or ADP/Ca(2+) does not. A high strand exchange activity is observed for the filament formed with ATP/Ca(2+), whereas the other filaments exhibit lower activity. Molecular modelling suggests that the structural variation is caused by the divalent cation interfering with the L2 loop close to the DNA-binding site. It is proposed that the larger Ca(2+) stabilizes the loop conformation and thereby the protein-DNA interaction. A tight binding of DNA, with bases perpendicularly oriented, could facilitate strand exchange.},

@inproceedings{Bacchus2007,
abstract = {In this paper we argue that an attractive and potentially very general way of achieving generalized arc consistency (GAC) on a constraint is by using unit propagation (UP) over a CNF encoding of the constraint. This approach to GAC offers a number of advantages over traditional constraint specific algorithms (propagators): it is easier to implement, it automatically provides incrementality and decrementality in a backtracking context, and it can provide clausal reasons to support learning and non-chronological backtracking. Although UP on standard CNF encodings of a constraint fails to achieve GAC, we show here that alternate CNF encodings can be used on which UP does achieve GAC. We provide a generic encoding applicable to any constraint. We also give structure specific encodings for the regular, among, and gen-sequence constraints on which UP can achieve GAC with the same run time bounds as previously presented propagators. Finally, we explain how a UP engine can be added to a CSP solver to achieve a seamless integration of constraints encoded in CNF and propagated via UP and those propagated via traditional constraint specific propagators.},

abstract = {Binuclear ruthenium complexes that bind DNA by threading intercalation have recently been found to exhibit an exceptional kinetic selectivity for long polymeric adenine-thymine (AT) DNA. A series of oligonucleotide hairpin duplexes containing a central tract of 6-44 alternating AT base pairs have here been used to investigate the nature of the recognition mechanism. We find that, above a threshold AT tract length corresponding to one helix turn of B-DNA, a dramatic increase in threading intercalation rate occurs. In contrast, such length dependence is not observed for rates of unthreading. Intercalation by any mechanism that depends on the open end of the hairpin was found not to be important in the series of oligonucleotides used, as verified by including in the study a hairpin duplex cyclized by a copper-catalyzed "click" reaction. Our observations are interpreted in terms of a conformational pre-equilibrium, determined by the length of the AT tract. We finally find that mismatches or loops in the oligonucleotide facilitate the threading process, of interest for the development of mismatch-recognizing probes.},

For this architecture, controllable events are assigned to be either "conjunctive" or "disjunctive." A new state estimator that accounts for past local control actions when calculating the set of estimated system states is presented. The new state estimator is applied to a previous general decentralized control law. The new control method generates a controlled language at least as large as that generated by the original method if a safety condition is satisfied. An algorithm for generating locally maximal control policies for a given state estimate is also discussed. The algorithm allows an amount of "steering" of the controlled system through an event priority mechanism.},

Although many studies already exist about Product Configuration, Requirements and Process Configuration have not been studied in detail. As all these three aspects must be considered for mass customization, the aim of this paper is to show how Product Configuration, when considered as a constraint satisfaction problem, can be extended upstream towards Requirements Configuration and downstream towards Process Configuration. Product Configuration basics are first reviewed thanks to a constraint based approach, and an analysis of industrial configuration situations is done in order to clarify mass customization needs in terms of configuration. Then upstream Requirements Configuration and downstream Process Configuration are defined and generic models are proposed. It is shown that the proposed elements allow a global and consistent flow of configuration activities. A detailed example illustrates the different configuration problems and a discussion terminates the paper.},

@techreport{Crow1994,
abstract = {We extend Reiter's general theory of model-based diagnosis to a theory of fault detection, identification, and reconfiguration (FDIR). The generality of Reiter''s theory readily supports an extension in which the problem of reconfiguration is viewed as a close analogue of the problem of diagnosis. Using a reconfiguration predicate rcfg analogous to the abnormality predicate ab, we derive a strategy for reconfiguration by transforming the corresponding strategy for diagnosis. There are two obvious benefits of this approach: first, algorithms for diagnosis can be exploited as algorithms for reconfiguration; second, we have a theoretical framework for an integrated approach to FDIR. As a first step toward realizing these benefits, we show that a class of diagnosis engines can be used for reconfiguration and we discuss algorithms for integrated FDIR. We argue that integrating recovery and diagnosis is an essential next step if this technology is to be useful for practical applications.},

abstract = {This paper introduces a novel approach for solving the Boolean satisfiability (SAT) problem by combining software and configurable hardware. The suggested technique avoids instance-specific hardware compilation and, as a result, allows the total problem solving time to be reduced compared to other approaches that have been proposed. Moreover, the technique permits problems that exceed the resources of the available reconfigurable hardware to be solved. The paper presents the results obtained with some of the DIMACS benchmarks and a comparison of our implementation with other available SAT solvers based on reconfigurable hardware. The hardware part of the satisfier was realized on Virtex XCV812E FPGA, which has a large volume of embedded memory blocks that provide direct support for the proposed approach.},

abstract = {In recent years, product knowledge has played increasingly significant roles in new product development process especially in the development of One-of-a-Kind products. Although knowledge-based systems (KBSs) have been proposed to support product development activities and new knowledge modelling methodologies have been developed, they are still far from complete. This area has become attractive to many researchers and as a result, many new knowledge-based systems, methods and tools have been developed. However, to the best of our knowledge, knowledge-based systems for product development have not been systematically reviewed, compared and summarized. This paper provides a comprehensive review on the recent development of KBS, methods and tools in supporting rapid product development. In the paper, the relevant technologies for modelling, managing and representing knowledge are investigated and reviewed systematically for better understanding their characteristics. The focus is placed on knowledge-based systems that support product development, and how product knowledge is identified, captured, represented and reused during the processes of One-of-a-Kind product development. The limitations and the future trend of KBS are presented in terms of how they can help One-of-a-Kind Production (OKP) companies.},

@phdthesis{Liffiton2009,
abstract = {Constraint systems, problems defined by sets of variables and constraints affecting the allowed assignments to those variables, arise in a wide range of real-world problems, from planning and scheduling to digital logic circuit verification. These problems have been studied widely in computer science and operations research, and a great deal of research has gone into developing algorithms that solve them quickly, producing assignments to variables that satisfy all of a system's constraints. Many constraint systems turn out to have no satisfying assignments -- they are said to be overconstrained or infeasible -- and work on analyzing these instances is much less mature. It is in this area that this work lies. Most work on analyzing infeasibility has focused on producing singular, approximate, partial views of the infeasibility of a given problem; a distinguishing feature of this work is that it is focused on complete analyses. We have developed algorithms that compute the full structure of a problem's infeasibility in the form of minimal correction sets (MCSes) and minimal unsatisfiable subsets (MUSes), both of which are subsets of a system's constraints that irreducibly describe part of its infeasibility. The value of these complete analyses has been demonstrated by applications of this work to two different logic circuit verification tasks, in which the complete views these algorithms produce have been shown to be critical for performance. Spurred partially by the needs of the industrial applications and also by theoretical considerations regarding the innate intractability of the given problems, extensions of these algorithms have been developed in several directions, enhancing performance by integrating partial, approximate analyses as guides, solving related problems that avoid the intractability while still providing more information than the singular views offered by other work, and generally exploring the space of infeasibility analysis in novel ways. Overall, this work helps to expand the field of constraint system research with new tools for analyzing infeasibility. This research, which has been kept as broadly-applicable as possible, serves as a base, opening up complete infeasibility analysis to researchers across the field of constraint research.},

They also exhibit differences in the way they are used to state and solve problems since SAT's approach is, in general, a black-box approach, while CP aims at being tunable and programmable.

We develop three heuristics for reducing the time and space required to do this. These heuristics are based on the distinctive clustered and hierarchical structure of the constraint graphs of configuration problems. The first heuristic attempts to limit the growth in the size of the decision diagram by providing an order in which constraints are added to the decision diagram. The second heuristic provides an initial order for the variables within the decision diagram. Finally, the third heuristic groups variables together so that they can be reordered by a dynamic variable reordering procedure used during the construction of the decision diagram. These heuristics provide one to two orders magnitude improvement in the time to compile a wide range of configuration.},

In this Review, we discuss the current chilly state of digital libraries for the computational biologist, including PubMed, IEEE Xplore, the ACM digital library, ISI Web of Knowledge, Scopus, Citeseer, arXiv, DBLP, and Google Scholar. We illustrate the current process of using these libraries with a typical workflow, and highlight problems with managing data and metadata using URIs. We then examine a range of new applications such as Zotero, Mendeley, Mekentosj Papers, MyNCBI, CiteULike, Connotea, and HubMed that exploit the Web to make these digital libraries more personal, sociable, integrated, and accessible places. We conclude with how these applications may begin to help achieve a digital defrost, and discuss some of the issues that will help or hinder this in terms of making libraries on the Web warmer places in the future, becoming resources that are considerably more useful to both humans and machines.},

abstract = {The existence of powerful constraint satisfaction algorithms is not the sole reason of the wide success of the CSP framework. The interest of this framework is also that it offers a generic and simple way for the modeling of real world applications. Nevertheless these applications call for tasks that often differ from a classical search for a solution. The aim of the present paper is not to provide the AI community with new and efficient algorithms, but with new requests and more generally new needs. All of them are issued from the analysis of the business needs that arise around the design and exploitation of the vehicle range at Renault, the French car manufacturer. Viewing this application as a fruitful source of research problematics for the community, we present a formalization and a theoretical study, in terms on complexity, of the series of requests risen by the application.

abstract = {{The gap between experimental objects and models for calculations in chemistry is being bridged. The size of experimental nano-objects is decreasing, while reliable calculations are feasible for larger and larger molecular systems. The results of these calculations for isolated molecules are becoming more relevant for experiments. However, there are still significant challenges for computational methods. This series of books presents reviews of current advances in computational methodologies and applications.  <P>Chapter 1 of this volume provides an overview of the theoretical and numerical aspects in the development of the polarizable continuum model (PCM). Chapter 2 demonstrates a multiplicative scheme used to estimate the properties of two- and three-dimensional clusters from the properties of their one-dimensional components. Chapter 3 discusses the application of ab initio methods for a reliable evaluation of the characteristics of hydrogen-bonded and van der Waals complexes.  <P>Ab initio quantum-chemical methods are popular among researchers investigating various aspects of DNA. The properties of DNA base polyads linked by base-base hydrogen bonds are reviewed in Chapter 4, while Chapter 5 reviews the primary radiation-induced defects in nucleic acid building blocks, and how DNA can be influenced by chemical and environmental effects. Finally, Chapter 6 discusses available experimental data of DNA bases, base pairs, and their complexes with water.}},

Although some of the presented query algorithms are in the worst case exponential in the tree width, our experiments show that ToB can answer non-trivial queries like clausal entailment in reasonable time for several realistic instances. While our ToB-tool compiles all the used 91 instances, d-DNNF compilation failed for 12 or 8 of them based on the decomposition heuristic used. Also, on the succeeded instances, a d-DNNF is up to 1000 times larger than the matching ToB. The ToB compilations are often an order of magnitude faster than the d-DNNF compilation. This makes ToB a quite interesting knowledge compilation form.},

abstract = {Before a combinatorial problem can be solved by current SAT methods, it must usually be encoded in conjunctive normal form, which facilitates algorithm implementation and allows a common file format for problems. Unfortunately there are several ways of encoding most problems and few guidelines on how to choose among them, yet the choice of encoding can be as important as the choice of search algorithm. This chapter reviews theoretical and empirical work on encoding methods, including the use of Tseitin encodings, the encoding of extensional and intensional constraints, the interaction between encodings and search algorithms, and some common sources of error. Case studies are used for illustration.},

There has been a resulting development of reconfigurable  computers-computers which have both general purpose  processors and reconfigurable hardware, as well as memory  and high-performance interconnection networks. In this paper,  we study the acceleration of molecular dynamics simulations  using reconfigurable computers. We describe how  we partition the application between software and hardware  and then model the performance of several alternatives  for the task mapped to hardware. We describe an  implementation of one of these alternatives on a reconfigurable  computer and demonstrate that for two real-world  simulations, it achieves a 2 speed-up over the software  baseline. We then compare our design and results to those  of prior efforts and explain the advantages of the hardware/  software approach, including flexibility.},

Such systems arise in a variety of contexts ranging from computer operating systems to the control of complex multimode processes. A control theory for the logical aspects of such DESs is surveyed. The focus is on the qualitative aspects of control, but computation and the related issue of computational complexity are also considered. Automata and formal language models for DESs are surveyed},

abstract = {The complexity of existing PLC programs precludes dealing with or modifying them. The interest in the formalization of PLC programs has increased in recent years to overcome this problem. Formal methods can provide for the development of PLC programs, since they serve as a medium to analyze and verify them due to increased awareness of safety and quality. This is done by performing what is known as verification and validation (V&V). Moreover formal methods support reuse of already implemented PLC programs to meet new production demands. This paper examines different possibilities to formalize PLC programs. It explains the pros and cons of these different alternatives. The paper outlines a formal description of timers and counters used in PLC programs according to the alternative that fulfills the criteria best.},

@phdthesis{Miremadi2012PhdThesis,
abstract = {With the increasing complexity of computer systems, it is crucial to have efficient design of correct and well-functioning hardware and software systems. To this end, it is often desired to control the behavior of systems to possess some desired properties. A specific class of systems is called discrete event systems (DES). DES deal with `discrete' quantities, e.g., ``number of robots in a manufacturing cell'', and their processes are driven by instantaneous `events', e.g., ``start of a machine''. In this thesis, the focus is on DES and an extension of such systems, which also considers the time points at which the events may occur, called \emph{timed DES (TDES)}. Real-time applications such as communication networks, manufacturing facilities, or the execution of a computer program, can be considered into TDES. Having a DES or TDES, with some given specifications, by utilizing a well-known mathematical framework, called supervisory control theory (SCT), it is possible to automatically generate a supervisor that restricts the system's behavior towards the specifications, only when it is necessary. Applying the SCT to large and complex systems, typically follows with some issues, concerning computational complexity and modeling aspects, which is tackled in this thesis. We model DES by extended finite automata (EFAs), state transition models that contain discrete-valued variables. TDES are modeled by an augmentation of EFAs, called timed EFAs (TEFAs), which contain a set of discrete-valued clocks. Based on EFAs or TEFAs, the supervisor can be symbolically computed, using binary decision diagrams (BDDs), data structures that could, in many cases, lead to smaller representation of the state space. For complex systems, the computed supervisor may consist of many states, causing representation and implementation difficulties. To tackle this, based on the states of the supervisor, we symbolically compute logical constraints that will be attached to the original models to restrict the system's behavior. Consequently, we present a framework, where given a set of EFAs or TEFAs, the supervisor is computed using BDDs, and represented in a modular manner based on the computed logical constraints. The framework has been developed, implemented, and applied to industrial case studies.},

In this paper we give a new, well-founded and relatively simple definition of such dynamic constraint satisfaction problems DCSP. On the basis of the definition, we show that the decision problem for DCSP is NP-complete. We also show that although the complexity of DCSP is the same as for CSP, DCSP is strictly more expressive in a knowledge representation sense. However, DCSP has its limitations in representing configuration knowledge. We generalise the activity constraints of DCSP with disjunctions and default negation, and show that the decision problem remains NP-complete with this generalization. We nally describe two approaches to implementing DCSP and provide test results for both.},

abstract = {The Boolean Satisﬁability (SAT) solvers have been in recent years very successful at solving very large practical problems, with hundreds of thousands of variables and millions of clauses. Although SAT can be viewed as a graphical model, it is intriguing that SAT solvers do not seem to perform anywhere close to the worst case upper bound that is known for graphical models algorithms (e.g., join-tree clustering or variable elimination), which are exponential in the treewidth of the primal graph. In this paper we empirically investigate the correlation between the treewidth of industrial SAT instances from the SAT2009 competition, and their practical hardness as given by the solving time.},

Using a simple case distinction on the fraction of critical variables of a CNF formula, we improve the running time for 3-SAT from O(1.32216^n) [Rolf 2006] to O(1.32153^n). Using a different approach, Iwama et al. very recently achieved a running time of O(1.32113^n). Our method nicely combines with theirs, yielding the currently fastest known algorithm with running time O(1.32065^n). We also improve the bound for 4-SAT from O(1.47390^n) [Hofmeister et al. 2002] to O(1.46928^n), where O(1.46981^n) can be obtained using the methods of Hofmeister and Rolf.},

abstract = {Although propositional satisfiability (SAT) is NP-complete, state-of-the-art SAT solvers are able to solve large, practical instances. The concept of backdoors has been introduced to capture structural properties of instances. A backdoor is a set of variables that, if assigned correctly, leads to a polynomial-time solvable sub-problem. In this paper, we address the problem of finding all small backdoors, which is essential for studying value and variable ordering mistakes. We discuss our definition of sub-solvers and propose algorithms for finding backdoors. We experimentally compare our proposed algorithms to previous algorithms on structured and real-world instances. Our proposed algorithms improve over previous algorithms for finding backdoors in two ways. First, our algorithms often find smaller backdoors. Second, our algorithms often find a much larger number of backdoors.},

In this paper, key success factors in the design of efficient BDD-based reachability algorithms for synthesis and verification are discussed. It is also shown how the modular structure of a discrete event system (DES) can be utilized by taking advantage of the process communication graph and partitioning techniques. A reachability algorithm based on these principles is discussed and a proof of correctness for the algorithm is given.},

abstract = {Network data frequently arises in a wide variety of fields, and node-link diagrams are a very natural and intuitive representation of such data. In order for a node-link diagram to be effective, the nodes must be arranged well on the screen. While many graph layout algorithms exist for this purpose, they often have limitations such as high computational complexity or node colocation. This paper proposes a new approach to graph layout through the use of space filling curves which is very fast and guarantees that there will be no nodes that are colocated. The resulting layout is also aesthetic and satisfies several criteria for graph layout effectiveness.},

abstract = {We describe the techniques we have used to search for bugs in the memory subsystem of a next-generation Alpha microprocessor. Our approach is based on two model checking methods that use satisfiability (SAT) solvers rather than binary decision diagrams (BDDs). We show that the first method, bounded model checking, can reduce the verification runtime from days to minutes on real, deep, microprocessor bugs when compared to a state-of-the-art BDD-based model checker. We also present experimental results showing that the second method, a version of symbolic trajectory evaluation that uses SAT-solvers instead of BDDs, can find as deep bugs, with even shorter runtimes. The tradeoff is that we have to spend more time writing specifications. Finally, we present our experiences with the two SAT-solvers that we have used, and give guidelines for applying a combination of bounded model checking and symbolic trajectory evaluation to industrial strength verification. The bugs we have found are significantly more complex than those previously found with methods based on SAT-solvers.},

However, existing tools suffer quadratic runtime in the number of symmetries explicitly returned and are of limited use on very large, sparse, symmetric graphs. This paper introduces a new symmetry-discovery algorithm which exploits the sparsity present not only in the input but also the output, i.e., the symmetries themselves. By avoiding quadratic runtime on large graphs, it improves state-of-the-art runtimes from several days to less than a second.},

abstract = {This paper addresses the industrial visualization tools used when validating vehicle configuration rules. The configuration rules are logic expressions allowing vehicle configurations to be built, as well as which components these configurations should consist of. Valid configuration rules are permitting vehicle configurations according to the specialists’ expectations. Those vehicles also have to have the correct components assigned. Currently, the validation of configuration rules partially relies on time-consuming manual inspection and calculations. Our aim is to find a demonstrator facilitating the validation of configuration rules by adding the calculations results to the industrial visualization methods. In doing so, it should also be possible to use one single user interface instead of the multiple used today. The work presented in this paper is rooted in user studies at the automotive companies including both interviews and observations. The identified typical rule queries when using the industrial visualization tools and the identified difficulties informed the development of a demonstrator. This paper describes the conducted usability tests of the demonstrator, showing how the users found the validation of configuration rules less error-prone, more time-efficient and easier to learn.},

@article{Sinz2006,
abstract = {Abstract As products are growing more complex, so is their documentation. With an increasing number of product options, the diversity in service and maintenance procedures grows accordingly. This trend also holds for large-scale medical devices such as magnetic resonance (MR) tomographs. Siemens Medical Solutions has thus decided against one common on-line service handbook for all its MR tomographs. Instead, they fragment the on-line documentation into small packages, out of which a suitable subset is selected for each individual product instance. Selection of (so-called) help packages is controlled by XML terms encoding Boolean choice conditions. To assure that the set of available help packages is sufficient for all valid product instances, we developed a tool called HelpChecker that provides a transformation of XML terms to propositional logic formulas and then employs BDD-based methods to ascertain completeness of the on-line documentation and to support authors in locating any gaps. Experiments with SAT-Solvers were also made.},

(1998) has a large compilation time overhead mainly due to placement and routing of many FPGAs. We attack the problem on three fronts. First, we partition the SAT solver into instance-specific and instance non-specific components. Secondly, we transform SAT instances into canonical forms; and finally we present a board-level multiple-chip architecture to solve large SAT instances. All these efforts amount to a reduction in placement and routing time to configure the configurable hardware. We are able to reduce the compilation time to mere routing time of the implication circuits for each instance of the SAT problem, given the best scenario},

We focus on how the surveyed techniques formulate the verification problem as a SAT problem and how they exploit crucial aspects of a SAT solver, such as application-specific heuristics and conflict-driven learning. Finally, we summarize the noteworthy achievements in this area so far and note the major challenges in making this technology more pervasive in industrial design verification flows.},

Based on the observations that text documents nor- mally lie over a planar or smoothly curved surface and have a uniformly colored background, badly illuminated docu- ment images are binarized by using a smoothing polynomial surface, which estimates the shading variation and com- pensates the shading degradation based on the estimated shading variation. Badly illuminated document images are accordingly binarized through the global thresholding of the compensated document images. Compared with the re- ported methods, the proposed technique is tolerant to the variations in text size and document contrast. At the same time, it is much faster and able to produce a binary text im- age with little background noise.},

These scalable parallel applications use spacetime multiresolution algorithms and feature computational-space decomposition, wavelet-based adaptive load balancing, and spacefilling-curve-based data compression for scalable I/O. Comparative performance tests are performed on a 1024-processor Linux cluster and a conventional higher-end parallel supercomputer, 1184-processor IBM SP4. The results show that the performance of the Linux cluster is comparable to that of the SP4. We also study various effects, such as the sharing of memory and L2 cache among processors, on the performance.},

We begin with a thorough experimental analysis of this algorithm configuration problem, using a simple random search pro- cedure to explore the parameter configuration spaces of high-performance algorithms for SAT and mixed integer programming. Next, we present a family of local-search-based algorithm configura- tion procedures, along with adaptive capping techniques for accelerating them. Finally, we describe the results of a comprehensive experimental evaluation of our methods, based on prominent com- plete and incomplete algorithms for SAT, and the commercial software CPLEX for mixed integer programming. In all cases, these algorithms default parameter settings had previously been manu- ally optimized with considerable effort; nevertheless, using our automated algorithm configuration procedures, we achieved substantial performance improvements.},

abstract = {Various encodings have been proposed to convert Constraint Satisfaction Problems (CSP) into Boolean Satisfiability problems (SAT). Some of them use a logical variable for each element in each domain: among these very successful are the direct and the support encodings. Other methods, such as the log-encoding, use a logarithmic number of logical variables to encode domains. However, they lack the propagation power of the direct and support encodings, so many SAT solvers perform poorly on log-encoded CSPs. In this paper, we propose a new encoding, called log-support, that combines the log and support encodings. It has a logarithmic number of variables, and uses support clauses to improve propagation. We also extend the encoding using a Gray code. We provide experimental results on Job-Shop scheduling and randomly-generated problems.},

abstract = {Verification and synthesis of control logic programs using Supervisory Control Theory (SCT) is an important topic. Most SCT methods are based on finite state automata (FA). FA extended with variables (EFA) are a compact, but otherwise equivalent to FA notation, proven to be beneficial in modeling control logic systems. To use existing SCT methods with EFA, it is necessary to convert EFA to FA. In certain cases this conversion can be very time-consuming, even if the number of resulting reachable states is very small compared to the total state-set of the system. In this paper we present a way to do verification of SCT properties of EFA models without converting them to FA. Instead, we convert them to the models for Symbolic Model Verification tool NuSMV. The conversion is performed in polynomial time. Experimental results show that NuSMV effectively utilizes small reachable state-set of the system to do verification.},

abstract = {The time complexity of supervisory control design for a general class of problems is studied. It is shown to be very unlikely that a polynomial-time algorithm can be found when either (1) the plant is composed of m components running concurrently or (2) the set of legal behaviors is given by the intersection of n legal specifications. That is to say, in general, there is no way to avoid constructing a state space which has size exponential in m+n. It is suggested that, rather than discouraging future work in the field, this result should point researchers to more fruitful directions, namely, studying special cases of the problem, where certain structural properties possessed by the plant or specification lend themselves to more efficient algorithms for designing supervisory controls. As no background on the subject of computational complexity is assumed, we have tried to explain all the borrowed material in basic terms, so that this paper may serve as a tutorial for a system engineer not familiar with the subject},

abstract = {In the supervisory control theory, a supervisor is generated based on given plant and specification models. The supervisor restricts the plant in order to fulfill the specifications. A problem that is typically encountered in industrial applications is that the resulting supervisor is not easily comprehensible for the users. To tackle this problem, we introduce an efficient method to characterize a supervisor by tractable logic conditions, referred to as guards, generated from the models. The guards express under which conditions an event is allowed to occur to fulfill the specifications. To obtain tractable guard expressions, we reduce them by exploiting the structure of the given models. In order to be able to handle complex systems efficiently, the models are symbolically represented by binary decision diagrams and all computations are performed on these data structures. The algorithms have been implemented in a supervisory control tool and applied to an industrially relevant example.},

The general notion of backdoors was recently introduced to explain the source of heavy-tailed behaviors in backtracking algorithms (Williams, Gomes, & Selman 2003a; 2003b). We describe empirical studies that show that the key faction,i.e., the ratio of the key size to the corresponding backdoor size, is a good predictor of problem hardness of ensembles and individual instances within an ensemble for structure domains with large key fraction.},

The assumption that, if one is to develop a set of similar programs over a period of time, one should consider the set as a whole while developing the first three approaches to the development, is discussed. A conventional approach called "sequential development" is compared to "stepwise refinement" and "specification of information hiding modules." A more detailed comparison of the two methods is then made. By means of several examples it is demonstrated that the two methods are based on the same concepts but bring complementary advantages.},

@incollection{Sakallah2009,
abstract = {Symmetry is at once a familiar concept (we recognize it when we see it!) and a profoundly deep mathematical subject. At its most basic, a symmetry is some transformation of an object that leaves the object (or some aspect of the object) unchanged. For example, a square can be transformed in eight different ways that leave it looking exactly the same: the identity “do-nothing” transformation, 3 rotations, and 4 mirror images (or reflections). In the context of decision problems, the presence of symmetries in a problem's search space can frustrate the hunt for a solution by forcing a search algorithm to fruitlessly explore symmetric subspaces that do not contain solutions. Recognizing that such symmetries exist, we can direct a search algorithm to look for solutions only in non-symmetric parts of the search space. In many cases, this can lead to significant pruning of the search space and yield solutions to problems which are otherwise intractable. This chapter explores the symmetries of Boolean functions, particularly the symmetries of their conjunctive normal form (CNF) representations. Specifically, it examines what those symmetries are, how to model them using the mathematical language of group theory, how to derive them from a CNF formula, and how to utilize them to speed up CNF SAT solvers.},

abstract = {The behaviour of asynchronous circuits is often described by signal transition graphs (STGs), which are Petri nets whose transitions are interpreted as rising and falling edges of signals. One of the crucial problems in the synthesis of such circuits is deriving equations for logic gates implementing each output signal of the circuit. This is usually done using reachability graphs. In this paper, we avoid constructing the reachability graph of an STG, which can lead to state space explosion, and instead use only the information about causality and structural conflicts between the events involved in a finite and complete prefix of its unfolding. We propose an efficient algorithm for logic synthesis based on the incremental Boolean satisfiability (SAT) approach. Experimental results show that this technique leads not only to huge memory savings when compared with the methods based on reachability graphs, but also to significant speedups in many cases, without affecting the quality of the solution.},

abstract = {Most approaches to model-based diagnosis describe a diagnosis for a system as a set of failing components that explains the symptoms. In order to characterize the typically very large number of diagnoses, usually only the minimal such sets of failing components are represented. This method of characterizing all diagnoses is inadequate in general, in part because not every superset of the faulty components of a diagnosis necessarily provides a diagnosis. In this paper we analyze the concept of diagnosis in depth exploiting the notions of implicate/implicant and prime implicate/implicant. We use these notions to consider two alternative approaches for addressing the inadequacy of the concept of minimal diagnosis. First, we propose a new concept, that of kernel diagnosis, which is free of this problem with minimal diagnosis. This concept is useful to both the consistency and abductive views of diagnosis. Second, we consider restricting the axioms used to describe the system to ensure that the concept of minimal diagnosis is adequate.},

@article{Cox2009,
abstract = {To get mechanistic insight into the DNA strand-exchange reaction of homologous recombination, we solved a filament structure of a human Rad51 protein, combining molecular modeling with experimental data. We build our structure on reported structures for central and N-terminal parts of pure (uncomplexed) Rad51 protein by aid of linear dichroism spectroscopy, providing angular orientations of substituted tyrosine residues of Rad51-dsDNA filaments in solution. The structure, validated by comparison with an electron microscopy density map and results from mutation analysis, is proposed to represent an active solution structure of the nucleo-protein complex. An inhomogeneously stretched double-stranded DNA fitted into the filament emphasizes the strategic positioning of 2 putative DNA-binding loops in a way that allows us speculate about their possibly distinct roles in nucleo-protein filament assembly and DNA strand-exchange reaction. The model suggests that the extension of a single-stranded DNA molecule upon binding of Rad51 is ensured by intercalation of Tyr-232 of the L1 loop, which might act as a docking tool, aligning protein monomers along the DNA strand upon filament assembly. Arg-235, also sitting on L1, is in the right position to make electrostatic contact with the phosphate backbone of the other DNA strand. The L2 loop position and its more ordered compact conformation makes us propose that this loop has another role, as a binding site for an incoming double-stranded DNA. Our filament structure and spectroscopic approach open the possibility of analyzing details along the multistep path of the strand-exchange reaction.},

abstract = {As outlined by [10] (Junker and Mailharro 2003, ILOG jConfigurator) ”constraint programming is well- suited to treat complex configuration constraints such as compatibility and requirement- constraints in addition to standard arithmetic, comparison, and boolean constraints”. As a consequence several configurators have been implemented that are based on this technology. Nevertheless, configuration applications are not be restricted to the sole problem of on-line product configuration. Different business tasks may occur at different steps of the life cycle of the product range, e.g. the design of the model, the management of the Bill of material, etc. In the present paper, we analyse and formalize a series of the business needs that arise around the problem of car configuration at Renault’s, the French car manufacturer. It appears that these tasks call for a series of requests to a constraint satisfaction problem (CSP) that often differ from the ones classically handeled by the contraint programming frameworks. This application actually appears as a fruitful source of research problematics for both the CSP community and the Configuration community. We aim at motivating this research, by a formalization and a theoretical study, in terms on complexity, of the series of requests risen by this application.},

abstract = {We propose a method for reducing the number of clocks of a timed automaton by combining two algorithms. The first one consists in detecting active clocks, that is, those clocks whose values are relevant for the evolution of the system. The second one detects sets of clocks that are always equal. We implemented the algorithms and applied them to several case studies. These experimental results show that an appropriate encoding of the state space, based on the output of the algorithms, leads to a considerable reduction of the memory space allowing a more efficient verification},

abstract = {The design of reduced supervisors, suboptimal but easier to compute, is placed in a general perspective. From this vantage point, we consider a timed discrete-event system, and compute a reduced supervisor based on an abstraction of the plant model in which time is measured with a slower clock. Such a model is simpler than the original, but has richer untimed behavior. Thus, a time-independent specification met by the closed-loop reduced system is also met by the original system when controlled by the same supervisor. The idea is illustrated with a simple example.},

Since logical (untimed) DES behaviours described by regular languages also form a lattice, questions of controllability for timed DES's may be treated in much the same manner as they are for untimed systems. In this paper we establish conditions for the controllability of timed DES performance specification which are expressed as inequations on the lattice of sequences. These specifications may take the form of sets of acceptable event occurrence times, maximum or minimum occurrence times, or limits on the separation times between events. Optimal behaviours are found as extremal solutions to these inequations using fixed point results for lattices},

abstract = {This paper reviews the substantial body of research into software and other tools to support the closely related methodologies of assembly system selection, design for assembly, and assembly planning. Reported research has led to the adoption of a number of tools in current use in manufacturing industry. Here, the scope of this research, and its practical applications, is considered with a view to identifying the application domain of each approach and support tool. The authors are led to the conclusion that there is a need for further research into a methodology for the initial selection of the assembly method (e.g. assembly line, fixed point assembly, etc), and that such a methodology should consider not only factors of product technology, but also the industrial environment where assembly is to take place. Further, a knowledge-based decision support tool could facilitate the application of this methodology, and expand decision support further into the selection of assembly planning methods for subsequent application.},

abstract = {We present a generalization of the classical supervisory control theory for discrete event systems to a setting of dense real-time systems modeled by Alur and Dill timed automata. The main problem involved is that in general the state space of a timed automaton is (uncountably) infinite. The solution is to reduce the dense time transition system to an appropriate finite discrete subautomaton, the grid automaton, which contains enough information to deal with the timed supervisory control problem (TSCP). The plant and the specifications region graphs are sampled for a granularity defined in a way that each state has an outgoing transition labeled with the same time amount. We redefine the controllability concept in the context of grid automata, and we provide necessary and sufficient solvability conditions under which the optimal solution to centralized supervisory control problems in timed discrete event systems under full observation can be obtained. The enhanced setting admits subsystem composition and the concept of forcible event. A simple example illustrates how the new method can be used to solve the TSCP.},

abstract = {This work discusses a new synthesis approach to the supervisory control of timed discrete event systems (TDES), that is more efficient than the existing approaches. With this method, many practical systems can be synthesized on a personal computer. The method exploits binary decision diagrams (BDDs), adapted to the specific structure of TDES. It is shown that the number of nodes in the BDD representing a TDES can be a better measure of the complexity of the TDES than the number of states and transitions. Structural information based on the ‘timers’ for a given TDES together with the reduction properties of BDDs contributes to efficient performance. The success of our approach is illustrated with large versions of an existing example taken from the literature.},

abstract = {This paper surveys the field of reinforcement learning from a computer-science perspective. It is written to be accessible to researchers familiar with machine learning. Both the historical basis of the field and a broad selection of current work are summarized. Reinforcement learning is the problem faced by an agent that learns behavior through trial-and-error interactions with a dynamic environment. The work described here has a resemblance to work in psychology, but differs considerably in the details and in the use of the word ``reinforcement.'' The paper discusses central issues of reinforcement learning, including trading off exploration and exploitation, establishing the foundations of the field via Markov decision theory, learning from delayed reinforcement, constructing empirical models to accelerate learning, making use of generalization and hierarchy, and coping with hidden state. It concludes with a survey of some implemented systems and an assessment of the practical utility of current methods for reinforcement learning.},

abstract = {In this paper, we introduce a control synthesis method for discrete event systems whose behavior is dependent on explicit values of time. Our goal is to control the occurrence dates of the controllable events so that the functioning of the system respects given specifications. The system to be controlled is modeled by a time Petri net. In a previous work we proposed a systematic method to build the timed automaton which models the exact behavior of a time Petri net. Furthermore, the forbidden behaviors of the system are modeled by forbidden timed automaton locations. This paper focuses on the control synthesis method, which consists in computing new firing conditions for the timed automaton transitions so that the forbidden locations are no longer reachable.},

Efficient solutions to this problem have been proposed in the context of finite-state models, based on the ioco contbmlance testing theory. We extend them in the context of infinite state specifications, modelled as automata extended with variables. We consider the selection of test cases according to test purposes describing abstract scenarios that one wants to test. The selection of program test cases then consists in syntactical transformations of the specification model, using approximate analysis. This paper is partly based on [11, 8, 12].},

A new type of abstraction called synthesis abstraction is introduced and three rules are proposed to calculate an abstraction of a given automaton. Furthermore, a compositional algorithm for synthesizing a supervisor for large-scale systems of composed finite-state automata is proposed. In the proposed algorithm, the synchronous composition is computed step by step and intermediate results are simplified according to synthesis abstraction. Then a supervisor for the abstracted system is calculated, which in combination with the original system gives the least restrictive, nonblocking, and controllable behaviour.},

abstract = {The time complexity of supervisory control design for a general class of problems is studied. It is shown to be very unlikely that a polynomial-time algorithm can be found when either (1) the plant is composed of m components running concurrently or (2) the set of legal behaviors is given by the intersection of n legal specifications. That is to say, in general, there is no way to avoid constructing a state space which has size exponential in m+n. It is suggested that, rather than discouraging future work in the field, this result should point researchers to more fruitful directions, namely, studying special cases of the problem, where certain structural properties possessed by the plant or specification lend themselves to more efficient algorithms for designing supervisory controls. As no background on the subject of computational complexity is assumed, we have tried to explain all the borrowed material in basic terms, so that this paper may serve as a tutorial for a system engineer not familiar with the subject.},

abstract = {A behavioral framework for control of (max,+) automata is proposed. It is based on behaviors (formal power series) and a generalized version of the Hadamard product, which is the behavior of a generalized tensor product of the plant and controller (max,+) automata in their linear representations. In the tensor product and the Hadamard product, the uncontrollable events that can neither be disabled nor delayed are distinguished. Supervisory control of (max,+) automata is then studied using residuation theory applied to our generalization of the Hadamard product of formal power series. This yields a notion of controllability of formal power series as well as (max,+)-counterparts of supremal controllable languages. Finally, rationality as an equivalent condition to realizability of the resulting controller series is discussed together with hints on future use of this approach.},

To this end, existing concepts for nonblocking abstractions such as natural observers and marked string accepting (msa)-observers are extended by local control consistency (LCC) as a novel sufficient condition for maximal permissiveness. Furthermore, it is shown that, similar to the natural observer condition and the msa-observer condition, also LCC can be formulated in terms of a quasi-congruence. Based on existing algorithms in the literature, this allows to algorithmically compute natural projections that are either natural observers or msa-observers and that additionally fulfill LCC. The obtained results are illustrated by the synthesis of nonblocking and maximally permissive supervisors for a manufacturing system.},

abstract = {An architecture for control of flexible production systems is presented, with focus on flexibility, generality, and reusability. The architecture is based on a framework which partitions the control system into the following main components: resources, product routes, control functions, the operator's interaction and the information system. The clear separation of the resources employed from the products' paths through the plant is important in order to simplify the handling of changes to the system, for instance when introducing new equipment or new product types. Compared to an earlier preliminary result [Lennartson, B, et al., Oct. 2002] this paper introduces a new formalism based on process algebra. It means that high level user friendly but still formal specifications are achieved for resources as well as product routes. Both event and state based specifications are illustrated related to industrial applications.},

abstract = {In the supervisory control theory, a supervisor is generated based on given plant and specification models. The supervisor restricts the plant in order to fulfill the specifications. A problem that is typically encountered in industrial applications is that the resulting supervisor is not easily comprehensible for the users. To tackle this problem, we introduce an efficient method to characterize a supervisor by tractable logic conditions, referred to as guards, generated from the models. The guards express under which conditions an event is allowed to occur to fulfill the specifications. To obtain tractable guard expressions, we reduce them by exploiting the structure of the given models. In order to be able to handle complex systems efficiently, the models are symbolically represented by binary decision diagrams and all computations are performed on these data structures. The algorithms have been implemented in a supervisory control tool and applied to an industrially relevant example.},

Specifically, this paper is interested in those systems which can be modeled by the framework proposed by the author in a previous publication. In addition, the system specifications can be expressed in terms of predicates. As this design approach does not rely on a search through the reachability graph of a real-time discrete-event system, it can effectively derive an appropriate controller for the intended control problem. This design advantage is demonstrated by an application example: the control of a small manufacturing system with moderate complexities},

Sequence planning is therefore an important activity throughout the complete development process. This paper proposes a sequence planning approach using self-contained manufacturing operations that model actions and relevant execution conditions. These operations can have temporal relations with each other, due to execution constraints expressed by operation pre- post- and reset conditions. The operation relations can for example be parallel, sequence, arbitrary order, alternative or hierarchy. Based on a formal operation model, the relations among operations are identified and visualized with a graphical language called Sequences of Operations, SOP.},

abstract = {Gene expression profiles have great potential as a medical diagnosis tool because they represent the state of a cell at the molecular level. In the classification of cancer type research, available training datasets generally have a fairly small sample size compared to the number of genes involved. This fact poses an unprecedented challenge to some classification methodologies due to training data limitations. Therefore, a good selection method for genes relevant for sample classification is needed to improve the predictive accuracy, and to avoid incomprehensibility due to the large number of genes investigated. In this article, we propose to combine tabu search (TS) and binary particle swarm optimization (BPSO) for feature selection. BPSO acts as a local optimizer each time the TS has been run for a single generation. The K-nearest neighbor method with leave-one-out cross-validation and support vector machine with one-versus-rest serve as evaluators of the TS and BPSO. The proposed method is applied and compared to the 11 classification problems taken from the literature. Experimental results show that our method simplifies features effectively and either obtains higher classification accuracy or uses fewer features compared to other feature selection methods.},

abstract = {This book's introduction features a humorous story of a man with a line of people behind him, who explains to his boss, "I can't find an efficient algorithm, but neither can all these famous people." This man illustrates an important quality of a class of problems, namely, the NP-complete problems: if you can prove that a problem is in this class, then it has no known polynomial-time solution that is guaranteed to work in general. This quality implies that the problem is difficult to deal with in practice. The focus of this book is to teach the reader how to identify, deal with, and understand the essence of NP-complete problems; Computers and Intractability does all of those things effectively. In a readable yet mathematically rigorous manner, the book covers topics such as how to prove that a given problem is NP-complete and how to cope with NP-complete problems. (There is even a chapter on advanced topics, with numerous references.) Computers and Intractability also contains a list of more than 300 problems-most of which are known to be NP-complete-with comments and references.},

abstract = {Considers the deadlock avoidance problem for the class of conjunctive/disjunctive (sequential) resource allocation systems (C/D-RAS), which allows for multiple resource acquisitions and flexible routings. First, a siphon-based characterization for the liveness of Petri nets (PNs) modeling C/D-RAS is developed, and subsequently, this characterization facilitates the development of a polynomial-complexity deadlock avoidance policy (DAP) that is appropriate for the considered RAS class. The resulting policy is characterized as C/D-RUN. The last part of the paper exploits the aforementioned siphon-based characterization of C/D-RAS liveness, in order to develop a sufficiency condition for C/D-RAS liveness that takes the convenient form of a mixed integer programming (MIP) formulation. The availability of this MIP formulation subsequently allows the correctness verification of any tentative C/D-RAS DAP for which the controlled system behavior remains in the class of PNs modeling C/D-RAS, and the effective flexibility enhancement of the aforementioned C/D-RUN DAP implementations. Finally, we notice that, in addition to extending and complementing the current theory on deadlock-free sequential resource allocation to the most powerful class of C/D-RAS, the presented results also (i) nontrivially generalize important concepts and techniques of ordinary PN structural analysis to the broader class of nonordinary PNs, while (ii) from a practical standpoint, they can find direct application in the (work-) flow management of modern production, service and/or transportation environments},

abstract = {The ever more rapidly changing markets pose high demands on the modern industry, often making it necessary to have varied and frequently updated product portfolios. As a consequence, modern industrial systems need to be easily adaptable to different kinds of products, which makes the use of flexible manufacturing systems (FMS) increasingly popular. An FMS generally contains a number of moving actors, such as production robots, conveyor belts, etc, that can be configured for different tasks. However, a big challenge with FMS is their high complexity, which makes FMS coordination a time and resource demanding undertaking. In this thesis, the challenge of FMS coordination is accepted, with the goal of developing methods for automatic and off-line generation of a correct, safe and time optimal working logic for the moving actors of a given FMS. This means that the order of operations in the studied FMS should minimize the total cycle time of the system and respect all specifications, while avoiding collisions and blocking situations between the moving actors. To represent possible and specified FMS behavior, deterministic finite automata (DFA) models are used. A method to automatically generate such models is presented, whereafter much work is laid at developing optimization methods, applicable to DFAs. While we start out with considering normal FMS behavior, a method for treating FMS that suffer from uncontrollable operations, such as machine breakdown or manually ordered product inspection, is also presented. When relating our results to the real world, we noted that the optimal control logic often induces uneven movement patterns to the FMS actors. This inconvenience is thus studied and amended. Finally, combining our results with some existing techniques, a framework for automatic generation of control code from 3D simulation models of FMS is presented. In developing this framework, functionality common to most robot simulation environments is used where possible to facilitate the portability of the approach between different simulation tools.},

abstract = {In order to develop a manufacturing automation system, it is necessary to understand the manufacturing operations and their relationship, the sequence of operations, which is the basis for control logic design. The operations have preconditions that define when they are allowed to start executing, which also defines the sequence relations among them. Requirements and demands throughout the development will add and change these conditions, which also changes the sequence of operations. This paper studies how an operation-oriented development approach better can handle the operations and manufacturing sequences from early product design to detailed control engineering. An operation is defined by an extended finite automaton, with an initial, executes and finished location. The start event is enabled by a precondition, the stop event is enabled by a postcondition and the reset event is enabled by a reset condition. This representation together with a resource and product description enables the possibility to integrate control logic in the complete development process.},

For this development, a control theory for TDES is introduced in the spirit of a prior theory of Brandin. A notion of time control structures is introduced, and on its basis a general property of hierarchical consistency is achieved by establishing control consistency — namely preservation of time control structures through the aggregation mapping in a two-level hierarchy.},

abstract = {We propose timed (finite) automata to model the behavior of real-time systems over time. Our definition provides a simple, and yet powerful, way to annotate state-transition graphs with timing constraints using finitely many real-valued clocks. A timed automaton accepts timed words–infinite sequences in which a real-valued time of occurrence is associated with each symbol. We study timed automata from the perspective of formal language theory: we consider closure properties, decision problems, and subclasses. We consider both nondeterministic and deterministic transition structures, and both B\"{u}chi and Muller acceptance conditions. We show that nondeterministic timed automata are closed under union and intersection, but not under complementation, whereas deterministic timed Muller automata are closed under all Boolean operations. The main construction of the paper is an (PSPACE) algorithm for checking the emptiness of the language of a (nondeterministic) timed automaton. We also prove that the universality problem and the language inclusion problem are solvable only for the deterministic automata: both problems are undecidable ($\Pi$11-hard) in the nondeterministic case and PSPACE-complete in the deterministic case. Finally, we discuss the application of this theory to automatic verification of real-time requirements of finite-state systems.},

Introductory discussions on stochastic nets with their application to performance modeling, and on high-level nets with their application to logic programming, are provided. Also included are recent results on reachability criteria. Suggestions are provided for further reading on many subject areas of Petri nets},

Two orthogonal extensions of PTL (timed propositional temporal logic and metric temporal logic) that inherit its appeal are defined: they capture elementary, yet expressively complete, fragments of the theory of timed state sequences, and thus are excellent candidates for practical real-time specification languages},

abstract = {In order to obtain a unified information flow from early product design to final production, an integrated framework for product, process and automation design is presented. The framework is based on sequences of operations and includes a formal relation between product properties and process operations. This relation includes liaisons (interfaces) and precedence relations, where the precedence relations generate preconditions for the related process operations. From this information a set of sequences of operations (SOPs) is generated. A formal graphical language for hierarchical operations and SOPs is then introduced and defined based on automata extended with variables. Since the operations are self-contained they can be grouped and viewed from different angles, e.g., from a product or a resource perspective. These multiple views increase the interoperability between different engineering disciplines. A case study is performed on a car manufacturing cell, where the suggested modeling framework is shown to give comprehensible SOPs.},

abstract = {A method for automatic generation of non-blocking controllers that generate collision-free flexible manufacturing cells is presented in this paper. Today, industry demands on flexible production sometimes require significant changes in location, orientation and configuration of industrial robots and other moving devices, when new products are introduced. All these changes pose a threat to the devices to collide while sharing workspace. Although the use of simulation software to facilitate these changes is gaining popularity, the coordination of collision-free flexible manufacturing systems is still at best a semi-manual trial-and-error procedure. To avoid this, a formal model of the operations in a manufacturing system is generated, and for each operation state a corresponding 3D simulation shape is created. A collision-free system is then achieved by considering pairs of colliding shapes as forbidden states. The automatic generation also includes a synthesis procedure, where a non-blocking and controllable supervisor is generated based on guard generation. The guards are computed by binary decision diagrams, which means that complex systems can be handled, still generating comprehensible restrictions that are easily included in PLC-code.},

abstract = {The aim of this paper is to show how the international standard STEP-AP214 can be used for communication and storing of process specifications. Even though there are several software tools available for the generation of both product and resource information systems, there is still a lack of tools related to the STEP standard for producing process information, e.g., sequence of operations and system capabilities for resource allocation. Therefore, such a tool is suggested, which makes use of a high-level language for discrete-event systems based on process algebra and Petri nets. This language, called process algebra Petri net), has been developed in accordance with the process relations defined in STEP-AP214. More specifically, it is shown how process specifications created with the PPN tool can be mapped to the STEP AP-214 format. Note to Practioners-Rapidly changing market needs is making demands on flexibility and ability to shorten lead times. Standards for exchanging information, as well as formal methods for automatic development of programmable controller code have been important research topics for many years. There are a lot of software tools available for the generation of both product- and resource information, but there is still a lack of tools for producing process information. Moreover, the connection between information exchange standards and such tools is absent, which makes the development of programmable controller code an isolated activity. This activity is often time consuming and performed in an ad hoc manner resulting in unnecessary production delay. The aim of this paper is to show how the international standard STEP-AP214 (a standard for exchange of product-, process-, and resource related information) can be used for communicating and storing process specifications. In order to achieve this, a tool which makes use of a formal high-level language is suggested. This tool can be used for automatic control generation and has been developed in a- ccordance with the process relations defined in STEP-AP214. A further aim is to shown how the mentioned tool can be used to specify complex systems in a compact, yet highly readable manner, which is a crucial incentive for industry to use formal methods. The presented method will guarantee that expected information is delivered quickly and without errors caused by the human factor, something that is very important in our ambition to achieve shortened lead times. The quick information exchange also makes it possible to perform simulation, supervisor synthesis, and verification early in the development phase. This is a first attempt at using a formal language for creating a tool that can automatically generate specifications in accordance with the international STEP-standard.},

abstract = {In flexible manufacturing systems a large number of operations need to be coordinated and supervised to avoid blocking and deadlock situations. The synthesis of such supervisors soon becomes unmanageable for industrial manufacturing systems, due to state space explosion. In this paper we therefore develop some reduction principles for a recently presented model based on self-contained operations and sequences of operations. First sequential operation behaviors are identified and related operation models are simplified into one model. Then local transitions without interaction with other operation models are removed. This reduction principle is applied to a synthesis of non-blocking operation sequences, where collisions among moving devices are guaranteed to be avoided by a flexible booking process. The number of states in the synthesis procedure and the computation time is reduced dramatically by the suggested reduction principle.},

abstract = {Methods for determining the network reliability of a multihop packet radio network in the presence of hostile jammers are discussed. A new connectivity parameter called radio connectivity is defined as the maximum number of disjoint communication paths that are still usable between given nodes s and d after the jammer is on or, more generally, the minimum number of jammers needed to disconnect s and d. A lower bound on the radio connectivity is computed by studying the number of jamming independent paths. The time complexity of obtaining the radio connectivity is analyzed and shown to be NP-hard except for some special cases. Greedy heuristics for developing approximate answers for general networks are described. Euclidean networks, in which the nodes and links correspond to points and line segments in the Euclidean geometry and satisfy Euclid's four fundamental axioms, are also discussed. It is found that the maximum number of independent paths between a pair of source and destination nodes that can possibly exist is five. An extension in which there is a protected zone of known size around the sender and receiver is studied},

abstract = {Within the discrete-event system setting, an abstract hierarchical control theory is developed on the basis of the concepts of control structures and observers. Control structure is an abstract generalization of the family of controllable sublanguages in the Ramadge-Wonham framework. With control structures, we establish a general version of Zhong's hierarchical consisten cy by first achieving control consistency - preservation of control structures through the aggregation mapping in a two-level hierarchy. Then we extend th e hierarchical theory to the setting of timed discrete-event systems. For a refinement of hierarchical consistency with preservation of the nonblocking property, the concept of observer is introduced via congruences on nondeterministic transition structures. Characterizations of observers with prefix-closure and postfix-closure operators are given. A close relation wa s discovered between our observer and Milner's observation equivalence. On the basis of control structures and observers other architectural situati ons are studied, namely modular control, coordination, and decentralized control . Modular control is equivalent to the requirement that sets of controllable languages in a control structure be lattices; a hierarchical coordination sc heme is set up to resolve conflicts among modular supervisors; and conditions are obtained under which the concurrent behaviour of two decentralized superviso rs is the same as global supervision.},

abstract = {Our growing dependence on increasingly complex computer and software systems necessitates the development of formalisms, techniques, and tools for assessing functional properties of these systems. One such technique that has emerged in the last twenty years is model checking, which systematically (and automatically) checks whether a model of a given system satisfies a desired property such as deadlock freedom, invariants, or request-response properties. This automated technique for verification and debugging has developed into a mature and widely used approach with many applications. Principles of Model Checking offers a comprehensive introduction to model checking that is not only a text suitable for classroom use but also a valuable reference for researchers and practitioners in the field. The book begins with the basic principles for modeling concurrent and communicating systems, introduces different classes of properties (including safety and liveness), presents the notion of fairness, and provides automata-based algorithms for these properties. It introduces the temporal logics LTL and CTL, compares them, and covers algorithms for verifying these logics, discussing real-time systems as well as systems subject to random phenomena. Separate chapters treat such efficiency-improving techniques as abstraction and symbolic manipulation. The book includes an extensive set of examples (most of which run through several chapters) and a complete set of basic results accompanied by detailed proofs. Each chapter concludes with a summary, bibliographic notes, and an extensive list of exercises of both practical and theoretical nature.},

Using eligible time bounds, the notions of trace-controllability and time-controllability of timed languages are proposed. Based on these notions, necessary and sufficient conditions for the existence of a supervisor for a real-time DES to achieve the given timed language specification are presented. The proposed approach shows that an exhaustive enumeration of the language generated in timed transition models is not needed to verify such existence conditions of the supervisor.},

abstract = {A hierarchical control theory is presented founded upon the trace-dynamical consistency property, which is an extension of the notion of dynamical consistency (DC) to the supervisory case of automata with disablable transitions. Partitions of a system state space are considered for which both the trace-DC and the (non-blocking) in-block controllability (IBC) conditions hold; it is shown that low-level non-blocking controllable languages project up to such languages in the high-level system, and that, when the (non-blocking) IBC condition also holds, high-level non-blocking controllable languages map down to such languages in the low-level system. It is demonstrated that the resulting pairs of low-level and high-level languages satisfy a version of the hierarchical consistency condition found in the existing language-based hierarchical supervisory control theory. The structures produced in the formulation of hierarchical control in this paper permit efficient regulator design (and, in particular, repeated re-design) for hierarchy-compatible language specifications; such specifications consist of low-level languages whose maximal controllable sublanguages are realizable by a combination of a high-level (possibly history-dependent) regulator and a set of (state-dependent) low-level regulators (specified block-wise). An algorithm is proposed which facilitates the construction of (non-blocking) IBC partitions of systems with vocalized states. Examples are presented, including a material transfer line with re-entrant flow and a double queue},

abstract = {In this paper we illustrate a compositional method for modeling the concurrent execution of working processes in flexible manufacturing systems (FMS) through a special class of Petri nets that we call S3 PR. In essence, this class is built from state machines sharing a set of places modeling the availability of system resources. The analysis of S3PR leads us to characterize deadlock situations in terms of a zero marking for some structural objects called siphons. In order to prevent the system from deadlocks, we propose a policy for resource allocation based on the addition of new places to the net imposing restrictions that prevent the presence of unmarked siphons (direct cause of deadlocks). Finally we present the application of this technique to a realistic FMS case},

abstract = {A limitation of the Ramadge and Wonham framework for the supervisory control theory is the explicit state representation using finite automata, often resulting in complex and unintelligible models. Extended finite automata (EFAs), i.e., deterministic finite automata extended with variables, provide compact state representation and then make the control logic transparent through logic expressions of the variables. A challenge with this new control framework is to exploit the rich control structure established in RW framework. This report studies the decentralized control structure with EFAs. To reduce the computation complexity, the controller is synthesized on the model abstraction of subsystems and the global model of the entire system is unnecessary. Sufficient conditions are presented to guarantee the decentralized supervisors result in maximally permissive and nonblocking control to the entire system.},

For several classes of problems, comparing the behavior of sets of interacting finite automata is found to be PSPACE-complete even in the case of automata accepting prefix-closed languages (equivalently, even when all states are marked). The paper uses these results to investigate the computational complexity of problems related to the verification of supervisory controllers for modular discrete-event systems. Modular discrete-event systems are sets of finite automata combined by the parallel composition operation. We find that a large number of modular discrete-event system verification problems are also PSPACE-complete, even for prefix-closed cases. These results suggest that while system decomposition by parallel composition could lead to significant space savings, it may not lead to sufficient time savings that would aid in the study of "large-scale" systems.},

Finite state automata (FSA) are convenient for studying (i.e., analyzing, designing) DES, and timed automata (TA) are convenient for describing real-time DES. An approach for studying a real-time DES, has been to transform a TA describing the real-time DES into an equivalent FSA, and then to study the latter. We propose here a new transformation method of TA into FSA. The method is well suited for conformance testing and supervisory control of real-time DES.},

abstract = {The Microrover Flight Experiment (MFEX) is a NASA OACT (Office of Advanced Concepts and Technology) flight experiment which, integrated with the Mars Pathfinder (MPF) lander and spacecraft system, landed on Mars on July 4, 1997. In the succeeding 30 sols (1 sol=1 Martian day), the Sojourner microrover accomplished all of its primary and extended mission objectives. After completion of the originally planned extended mission, MFEX continued to conduct a series of technology experiments, deploy its alpha proton X-ray spectrometer (APXS) on rocks and soil, and image both terrain features and the lander. This mission was conducted under the constraints of a once-per-sol opportunity for command and telemetry transmissions between the lander and Earth operators. As such, the MFEX rover was required to carry out its mission, including terrain navigation and contingency response, under supervised autonomous control. For example, goal locations were specified daily by human operators; the rover then safely traversed to these locations. During traverses, the rover autonomously detected and avoided rock, slope, and drop-off hazards, changing its path as needed before turning back towards its goal. This capability to operate in an unmodeled environment, choosing actions in response to sensor input to accomplish requested objectives, is unique among robotic space missions to date},

abstract = {Due to the ever-increasing complexity of software and hardware, it is becoming more and more important to develop methods and tools for automatic analysis and synthesis of systems. One obstacle in achieving this goal has been the unmanageable size and complexity of the involved mathematical operations. For example, real-world systems such as manufacturing cells or embedded systems represented as composite discrete-event systems tend to have huge numbers of states. The enormity of these models will make most types of analysis very hard if not impossible. Taking advantage of Binary Decision Diagrams, this work presents a set of algorithms and heuristics for searching the enormous state-space of large discrete event systems in a efficient manner. Furthermore, the author demonstrates how important problems within the field of supervisor control theory can be solved using the presented search methods. It is also shown how the conjunction of such methods and algorithmic optimization is used to gain performance even more.},

abstract = {The concept of observer was introduced in previous work by the authors on a hierarchical control theory of discrete-event systems (DES). It was shown that the observer property ensures that in a two-level hierarchy the low-level implementation of a nonblocking high-level supervisor is also nonblocking. In this paper we investigate the following problem: Given a causal reporter map that is not an observer, how do we design an observer by modifying the given map? In the case where the given causal reporter map is represented by a finite Mealy automaton, an effective computational algorithm is developed for computing an observer with the coarsest possible equivalence kernel that is finer than that of the given map. Three examples are provided for illustration. I. Introduction The concept of observer was introduced in [7], where it was shown to play a useful role in the hierarchical control theory of [9] by ensuring the preservation of the nonblocking property from a high-level control ...},

abstract = {Consumer product life-cycles are constantly shortening; the automotive industry is an illustrative example. As a consequence, the introduction of new products into the manufacturing system necessarily becomes more frequent. Inherently, this brings a performance reduction for the manufacturing system. The reduced performance is caused by a down-time and a ramp-up-time. During the down-time the mechanical equipment is rebuilt and the new control programs are debugged. During ramp-up there are a large number of errors mainly caused by mechanical devices not being properly adjusted, bugs in the control programs and operators not used to new procedures. Thus, in order to maintain the productivity level and to achieve full cost-efficiency both the down-time and the ramp-up time must be reduced. One way to reduce the down-time and the ramp-up time is to verify the control programs in offline mode. However, efficient and reliable offline verification requires some major improvements of the current development process of manufacturing systems. Information handling and development of control programs based on information reuse are the two most important improvement areas. The work presented in this thesis addresses three industrial problems, lack of tools for offline verification of control programs, lack of information reuse in the development process of a manufacturing system, and lack of operator support in error situations. The method proposed in this thesis provides results that solve the industrial problems without adding work to the development process. On the contrary, the amount of work will be reduced since the control program development will be automated and the time for debugging the control programs on the shop floor will be drastically reduced, due to the new mathematically based verification process. In the proposed method information from different tools in the development process of a manufacturing system is reused and processed by tools for verification and optimization. Then the control programs are generated by combining the processed information with a library of standardized software components.},

abstract = {This paper presents algorithms for the symbolic synthesis of discrete and real-time controllers. At the semantic level the controller is synthesized by finding a winning strategy for certain games defined by automata or by timed-automata. The algorithms for finding such strategies need, this way or another, to search the state-space of the system which grows exponentially with the number of components. Symbolic methods allow such a search to be conducted without necessarily enumerating the state-space. This is achieved by representing sets of states using formulae (syntactic objects) over state variables. Although in the worst case such methods are as bad as enumerative ones, many huge practical problems can be treated by fine-tuned symbolic methods. In this paper the scope of these methods is extended from analysis to synthesis and from purely discrete systems to real-time systems.},

abstract = {This paper investigates the interaction and relationship between the product design and the control logic design for manufacturing automation system. One important challenge during the development of a manufacturing automation system, is to handle the information related to the manufacturing control system (i.e PLC), since it influences almost every part of the manufacturing design and process. Therefore it is crucial to know when and how this information is created, to be able to increase the development quality and efficiency. This is especially true for the product related information that impacts the design of the control system. This paper studies the liaisons, the interfaces among parts and features in the product design, and its relationship with operations and resources in the manufacturing system. These liaisons must be considered in both product and manufacturing development since the inter-relation between liaisons and operations establishes the direct mapping of constraints and demands between the two domains. This paper further proposes how the manufacturing operations can be described during the development and how they are realized by resources in the manufacturing system. An example from automotive industry is included in this paper, to demonstrate the proposed concept.},

abstract = {Let PT-DFA mean a deterministic finite automaton whose transition relation is a partial function. We present an algorithm for minimizing a PT-DFA in $O(m \lg n)$ time and $O(m+n+\alpha)$ memory, where $n$ is the number of states, $m$ is the number of defined transitions, and $\alpha$ is the size of the alphabet. Time consumption does not depend on $\alpha$, because the $\alpha$ term arises from an array that is accessed at random and never initialized. It is not needed, if transitions are in a suitable order in the input. The algorithm uses two instances of an array-based data structure for maintaining a refinable partition. Its operations are all amortized constant time. One instance represents the classical blocks and the other a partition of transitions. Our measurements demonstrate the speed advantage of our algorithm on PT-DFAs over an $O(\alpha n \lg n)$ time, $O(\alpha n)$ memory algorithm.},

abstract = {Technical developments in computer hardware and software now make it possible to introduce automation into virtually all aspects of human-machine systems. Given these technical capabilities, which system functions should be automated and to what extent? We outline a model for types and levels of automation that provides a framework and an objective basis for making such choices. Appropriate selection is important because automation does not merely supplant but changes human activity and can impose new coordination demands on the human operator. We propose that automation can be applied to four broad classes of functions: 1) information acquisition; 2) information analysis; 3) decision and action selection; and 4) action implementation. Within each of these types, automation can be applied across a continuum of levels from low to high, i.e., from fully manual to fully automatic. A particular system can involve automation of all four types at different levels. The human performance consequences of particular types and levels of automation constitute primary evaluative criteria for automation design using our model. Secondary evaluative criteria include automation reliability and the costs of decision/action consequences, among others. Examples of recommended types and levels of automation are provided to illustrate the application of the model to automation design.},
